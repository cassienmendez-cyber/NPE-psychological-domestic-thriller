# BRAIN DUMP: "The Memory House" (Working Title)

**Date Started:** December 10, 2025
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025

---

## DUMP ZONE
**NO RULES. NO STRUCTURE. JUST GET IT OUT.**

She finds the note in her handwriting. She doesn't remember writing it. It says "DON'T TRUST HIM." Her husband says she wrote it during one of her "episodes." She's not sure what's real anymore. The new girl, Claire, the live-in assistant, keeps watching her with these knowing eyes. Like she SEES something. Or knows something. Or is part of something.

What if she's not losing her mind? What if he IS doing this to her? But then why do the medical tests show cognitive decline? Can you gaslight someone into dementia? Can terror cause the same symptoms?

Claire came from nowhere. Perfect resume. Perfect smile. Too perfect. She organizes pills. She watches. She takes notes. She says it's "for the doctor." But what if it's for him?

The house is too big. Too many rooms. Too many places to hide things. To hide people. Did she hear someone crying in the walls last night or was that her?

He used to look at her the way he now looks at Claire. Or is she imagining that too?

What if Claire isn't there to help her? What if Claire is there to replace her? What if Claire has been planning this for months—to slide into her life, her marriage, her identity, while she slowly disappears?

But WHAT IF—Claire is the only one who believes her? What if Claire is actually trying to save her?

TWIST: What if CLAIRE is unreliable? What if Claire has done this before? What if there was another wife?

---

## THINGS I KNOW FOR SURE
**The 2-5 things you're absolutely certain about**

- Dual POV: Emma (the wife, 38) and Claire (the assistant, 29) - both first person, both unreliable
- Emma is experiencing memory loss/confusion - BUT we don't know if it's medical, manufactured, or psychological trauma
- Claire has inserted herself into this household with a hidden agenda - but her true motives won't be clear until late in the story
- The husband, David, is either a devoted spouse caring for his sick wife OR a calculating abuser destroying her sanity OR something more complex (possibly also a victim)
- There was another woman before Emma. David's first wife. She "died" but we don't know the real story

---

## THINGS I'M PLAYING WITH
**The maybe stuff / ideas you're testing**

- Emma might be experiencing early-onset dementia, OR she might be drugged, OR she might be suffering from extreme stress/trauma that mimics cognitive decline
- Claire might be: (a) David's accomplice, (b) a vigilante trying to expose him, (c) the first wife's sister seeking revenge, (d) someone with her own obsession with Emma or David
- The house itself might be part of the gaslighting - renovations, moved furniture, changed locks, hidden rooms
- Emma's mother died in a memory care facility - is this genetic or is this a planted fear?
- Claire keeps a journal we glimpse in her POV - but is what she writes TRUE or is she creating a narrative?
- Medical records might be falsified
- Emma might have done something terrible she doesn't remember - this could be why David is "punishing" her OR why she's blocking memories
- The "episodes" Emma has might be her actually REMEMBERING the truth, not losing her grip on reality

---

## VIBES / MOOD / FEELING
**What does this story FEEL like?**

Suffocating. Like being underwater and not knowing which way is up. Intimate horror—the kind that happens in beautiful houses with good thread counts. The paranoia of not trusting your own mind. The violation of someone else controlling your reality.

Domestic but dangerous. Pretty on the surface, rotting underneath. Like a perfect apple with a razor blade inside.

Quiet dread that builds to explosive confrontation. The creeping sense of being watched in your own home. The fear of becoming invisible, of being erased while still alive.

Claustrophobic even in large spaces. The walls closing in. Shadows that might be people. Reflections that don't quite match. The terror of realizing you've been living with a stranger—or that you've become a stranger to yourself.

---

## QUESTIONS I HAVE
**All the "what if" and "how does" and "why would" questions**

- What if Emma is right about everything but has no way to prove it because her own mind is the crime scene?
- What if Claire started with good intentions but is now in too deep?
- What if David genuinely loves Emma but is also destroying her?
- How does someone systematically erase another person without killing them?
- Why would Claire risk everything to enter this household? What's her real endgame?
- What happened to the first wife? Did she actually die or is she still alive somewhere?
- What if Emma and Claire end up needing each other to survive?
- Could Emma's "episodes" be triggered intentionally? Drugged? Manipulated with specific stimuli?
- What if there's proof of what's happening but it's hidden in Emma's own "confused" writings that no one takes seriously?
- What role do the supporting characters play—do they see the truth and stay silent? Or are they genuinely fooled?
- What if the biggest twist is that Emma is actually the dangerous one and Claire walked into a trap?

---

## IMAGES / SCENES IN MY HEAD
**Fragments, moments, visuals that won't leave you alone**

- Emma finding dozens of notes in her own handwriting, all contradicting each other, all hidden in strange places (inside books, taped under drawers, in coat pockets)
- Claire organizing pills on the marble kitchen counter in perfect rows while Emma watches from the doorway, unsure if she's supposed to be taking them
- A scene where Emma is certain she locked the bedroom door but wakes to find it open, David asleep beside her, and Claire standing in the hallway in the dark
- Emma watching home videos from six months ago and not recognizing herself—she's different, says things she doesn't remember believing, laughs in a way that sounds wrong
- Claire's hands trembling as she unlocks a storage unit that contains files, photos, evidence of something
- A dinner party where Emma realizes mid-conversation that no one is actually listening to her—they're all looking at her with pity and talking around her like she's already gone
- The moment Emma finds Claire's journal and realizes Claire has been documenting everything—but whose side is the documentation for?
- Both women standing in front of the same mirror in different chapters, both asking themselves "What have I become?"
- The final confrontation in a memory care facility—but who's the patient and who's the visitor?

## CHARACTERS (MESSY NOTES)
**Names, traits, ideas, contradictions**

**Protagonist-ish:**

**EMMA TATE** (38) - Dual POV #1
- Former art gallery director, used to be sharp, confident, in control
- Now she's losing time, losing words, losing herself
- Keeps journals obsessively but then doesn't trust what she wrote
- Has a gap in her memory around how she and David actually met—realizes she tells different versions of the story
- Fights to stay present, to stay real, to stay HERE
- Unreliable because: genuinely can't remember things, traumatized, possibly drugged, possibly actually ill, desperate enough to misinterpret evidence
- Deeply afraid of ending up like her mother (who died not knowing her own name)
- May have secrets from before the memory loss began—something she did that she's now forgetting or repressing

**CLAIRE ALBRIGHT** (29) - Dual POV #2
- Appeared six months ago with perfect credentials as a "home health companion"
- Eerily calm, competent, organized
- Keeps detailed notes on everything—Emma's behavior, David's schedule, household patterns
- Has a storage unit full of something
- May be using a fake name
- Her backstory doesn't quite add up if you look closely
- Unreliable because: actively lying about her identity and purpose, has her own agenda, may be projecting her own trauma onto Emma's situation, selective about what she reveals
- Watchful, patient, strategic—but also impulsive when triggered
- Knows more about David's past than she should

**Antagonist-ish:**

**DAVID TATE** (42)
- Successful architect, charming, concerned husband
- Either genuinely devoted to his deteriorating wife OR masterfully destroying her
- Controls Emma's medical care, medications, access to doctors
- His first wife, REBECCA, died five years ago (car accident? suicide? murder?)
- Wealthy, connected, believable—everyone sides with him
- Hired Claire personally, very specific about what he wanted in an assistant
- May be having an affair with Claire OR may be her victim too
- Possible he's trying to recreate something from his first marriage

**Others:**

**DR. MARISSA CHEN** (50s) - Emma's neurologist
- Initially sympathetic but increasingly dismissive as Emma's "paranoia" grows
- Prescribed the medications Emma is on
- Long-time friend of David's family or colleague? Conflict of interest?
- Holds the medical power—her diagnosis shapes everything

**KATE MORRISON** (40) - Emma's sister
- Lives two hours away, visits monthly
- Wants to believe Emma but is convinced by David's evidence and the medical reports
- Torn between loyalty and realism
- Has her own family, can't take Emma in even if she wanted to
- Might be the first person to actually believe Emma—or the betrayal that breaks her

**JAMES PORTER** (38) - David's business partner
- Known David since college
- Dated Rebecca briefly before David married her
- Knows things about David's past but keeps quiet
- Attracted to Claire, which creates tension
- Could be an ally or another threat

**HELEN TATE** (70s) - David's mother
- Cold, elegant, protective of her son
- Loved Rebecca, tolerates Emma
- Drops hints that Emma was "always unstable"
- May know the real truth about Rebecca's death
- Lives in a guest house on the property (another set of eyes)

**MRS. VASQUEZ** (60s) - Housekeeper
- Has worked for the Tate family for 20+ years
- Sees everything, says little
- One moment of kindness toward Emma that suggests she knows
- Might be the witness everyone overlooks

---

## RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS
**Who's connected to who? How? Why does it matter?**

- **Emma & David:** Marriage crumbling under the weight of her illness (real or manufactured). He has all the power. She has all the fear. Love turning to suspicion or abuse disguised as care.

- **Emma & Claire:** Suspicious at first, then dependent, then maybe conspiratorial? Emma doesn't know if Claire is her jailer or her only hope. Claire may pity Emma or envy her or want to BE her.

- **David & Claire:** Boss and employee on the surface. Affair? Co-conspirators? Or is Claire playing him? The power dynamic shifts in Claire's POV chapters.

- **Claire & Rebecca (the dead wife):** The connection we don't see coming. Sister? Friend? Stranger obsessed with her story? This relationship drives Claire's real agenda.

- **Emma & Kate (sister):** The bond being slowly severed by Emma's unreliability. Kate is losing faith, which isolates Emma further. The moment Kate believes Emma again could be the turning point—or the tragedy.

- **David & Rebecca:** The ghost relationship that haunts everything. What really happened? Is David trying to recreate it or escape it?

- **Emma & Dr. Chen:** A medical relationship weaponized. Trust corrupted. The doctor becomes a tool of control rather than healing.

- **Emma & Helen (mother-in-law):** Hostile witness. Helen wants Emma gone—but why? To protect David or to hide something?

---

## SECRETS / LIES / HIDDEN THINGS
**What's buried? What's being hidden? From whom?**

- **Rebecca didn't die in an accident.** Something else happened. David was there. So was someone else.

- **Claire's real name isn't Claire Albright.** Her identity is constructed. Everything about her backstory is false.

- **Emma did something before her "illness" began**—found something, saw something, knew something. The memory loss might have started right after.

- **The medications Emma takes aren't what Dr. Chen says they are.** Or they're the right meds at the wrong doses. Deliberate fog.

- **David has done this before.** Rebecca showed the same symptoms before she died. There might be a pattern going back even further.

- **Claire has evidence**—photos, recordings, documents—hidden somewhere. But she's waiting for the right moment to use it, or she's protecting herself, or she's building her own case.

- **Emma wrote a letter to herself before the memory loss got bad.** It's hidden. If she finds it, everything changes. (Or does she find it multiple times and keep forgetting?)

- **Someone else lives in the house or used to.** The crying Emma hears. The moved objects. The feeling of being watched. Rebecca never left? Someone is kept in the house?

- **David's business is failing or built on fraud.** Emma's family money props it up. He needs her alive but incapacitated. Or he needs her dead but it has to look natural.

- **Claire is pregnant or was pregnant or lost a child.** This personal wound drives her actions.

- **Mrs. Vasquez knows everything.** She's been documenting it in her own way. She's the witness who could blow the whole thing open.

---

## POSSIBLE TWISTS / REVEALS
**Things that might blow up the story**

- **Emma has been drugged for months, but she's actually pregnant.** The baby is the evidence—drug traces in her system that medical tests will eventually reveal.

- **Claire is Rebecca's sister.** She's been planning this infiltration since Rebecca's death. She believes David killed Rebecca and is here to prove it and punish him. Emma is collateral damage—or the key to everything.

- **Emma killed someone before her memory loss began.** Self-defense, accident, murder—she doesn't remember. David is covering it up but using it as leverage. He manufactures her "illness" to keep her controllable and the secret buried.

- **There are TWO different plots happening.** David is gaslighting Emma (slow-motion murder for money/freedom). AND Claire is running her own con (revenge against David). Emma is caught between them, and neither cares if she survives.

- **The house has surveillance everywhere.** Everything Emma does is recorded. David watches it. Claire discovers this and now has access to proof of the gaslighting—but also to her own crimes/deceptions.

- **Emma has been writing lucid accounts of what's happening—detailed, accurate, damning.** But she hides them from herself because she knows David searches her things. The writings are hidden so well even SHE can't find them when she needs them. The search for her own testimony becomes a race against time.

- **Dr. Chen is being blackmailed or paid off.** She knows Emma isn't sick but falsifies records because David has something on her.

- **Claire isn't trying to save Emma—she's trying to take her place.** She wants David, the house, the life. She's making Emma look crazy to clear the path. She's the real villain.

- **The biggest twist: Emma is ACTUALLY ill, and her paranoid delusions are convincing Claire that David is guilty when he's not.** The tragedy is that Claire acts on false belief and destroys an innocent man trying to save his wife.

- **OR: Emma is ill AND being abused.** Both things are true. David is taking advantage of real cognitive decline to accelerate her deterioration. The cruelest version.

---

## SETTING FRAGMENTS
**Where does this happen? Details that matter.**

- **The House:** Modern architectural showpiece. David designed it. Glass walls, open concept, but somehow claustrophobic. Too many reflective surfaces. Feels like living in a display case. Three stories. Guest house where Helen lives. Basement level that's "storage" but locked. Located on a wooded property, isolated, 20 minutes from the nearest town.

- **Emma's bedroom/suite:** Has changed. She's certain the layout was different. Or was it? Locks on the outside? En-suite bathroom where she hides notes in the tile grout.

- **Claire's room:** Plain, impersonal, but she has a locked drawer. The one space she controls completely.

- **David's office:** Off-limits. Home surveillance system controlled from here. Files kept here.

- **The gallery where Emma used to work:** Closed now. She "left" six months ago when symptoms started. Or was she forced out? Can she go back and find allies?

- **The memory care facility where Emma's mother died:** Emma is terrified of this place. David suggests it gently, repeatedly. Preview of her future or the trap he's setting?

- **Claire's storage unit:** Off-site. Contains her real life, her evidence, her escape plan.

- **The town:** Small, affluent, everyone knows the Tates. David is respected. Emma is pitied. Claire is invisible.

---

## SCRAPS & CONTRADICTIONS
**The stuff that doesn't fit yet / things that conflict / loose ends**

- Does Claire actually care about Emma or is she just using her?
- Can both POVs be unreliable if the reader needs someone to trust?
- Is it MORE scary if we never know for sure what's real?
- The balance between psychological thriller and actual mystery—how much do we solve?
- Helen knows something but I don't know what yet
- James (business partner) feels important but I haven't cracked his role
- Do we ever see Rebecca? Flashbacks? Photos? Video? Ghost?
- Mrs. Vasquez might be my secret weapon but how do I use her without it feeling convenient?
- The title "The Memory House" might be too on-the-nose
- If Emma is being drugged, how does she get periods of clarity to narrate coherently? Or are her chapters increasingly fragmented as the book progresses?
- Should Claire's agenda be revealed early to readers but kept from Emma? Or hidden from everyone?
- The storage unit feels like a cliché—find something better?

## LINES / PHRASES / DIALOGUE FRAGMENTS
**Things characters might say or think**

**Emma:**
- "I know this sounds crazy, but I'm not crazy."
- "I found another note. My handwriting. I don't remember. I never remember."
- "He looks at me like I'm already gone."
- "Sometimes I catch Claire staring at me, and I can't tell if she sees a person or a problem to solve."
- "My mother forgot me three years before she died. I held her hand and she asked the nurse who I was."
- "What if the worst thing isn't losing my mind? What if it's being conscious while everyone treats me like I already have?"

**Claire:**
- "I'm good at becoming what people need. That's how I got here."
- "Emma asked me today if I believe her. I didn't answer."
- "He doesn't know who I really am. That's the only power I have."
- "I told myself I was doing this for the right reasons. I'm not sure that's true anymore."
- "Sometimes I forget which parts of my story are real and which parts I invented."

**David:**
- "I'm losing her a little more every day."
- "Claire, I need you to keep detailed notes. For the doctors. They'll need evidence of progression."
- "Emma, darling, we've been through this. You don't remember, but I do."
- "I loved her enough to let her go once. I won't make that mistake again."

**Dr. Chen:**
- "Confabulation is common in patients with her condition. She'll create false memories to fill in the gaps."
- "Mr. Tate, we should discuss next steps. In-patient care might be necessary soon."

**Kate (sister):**
- "Emma, you have to stop accusing him. He's trying to help you."
- "I want to believe you. I do. But you said the same thing about the neighbors, the mailman, your assistant at the gallery..."

## WHAT I'M AFRAID OF
**Story fears / what might go wrong / tropes to avoid**

- Making it too obvious too early who the "villain" is
- Losing sympathy for both POV characters if they're both unreliable—readers need someone to root for
- The "crazy woman" trope without subversion or depth—Emma needs agency even as she loses memory
- Disability used purely as plot device—if Emma has actual dementia, treat it with respect
- The twist being so convoluted it feels cheap
- Gaslighting plot that's been done better elsewhere (Rebecca, Behind Her Eyes, The Woman in the Window)
- Making Claire either too perfect (boring) or too villainous (one-dimensional)
- Ending that doesn't earn its darkness OR ending that's too neat
- Forgetting the 40-chapter structure and losing momentum in the middle
- Letting the mystery overshadow the emotional horror

---

## WHAT EXCITES ME
**Why am I writing this? What am I hungry to explore?**

- The terror of not being able to trust your own mind—what could be more fundamentally horrifying?
- Two women trapped in different ways, both unreliable, both possibly doomed, possibly saving each other
- Subverting the "crazy wife" trope by making it genuinely ambiguous whether she's sick, being destroyed, or both
- The intimacy of domestic horror—it's not a stranger in a mask, it's your husband at breakfast
- Playing with dual POV where BOTH narrators are lying (to us? to themselves?)
- The complexity of Claire as neither hero nor villain but something messier
- Exploring how women are systematically not believed, especially about their own experiences
- The question: Can you be unreliable AND right?
- Writing the slow build of dread, the suffocation of losing yourself
- The potential for a truly shocking twist that recontextualizes everything
- Creating a story where every time you think you know what's happening, the ground shifts

---

## RANDOM NOTES
**Literally anything else**

- Need to research: actual symptoms of early-onset dementia vs. symptoms of being drugged vs. symptoms of extreme psychological trauma (they overlap, which is the point)
- Research drugs that could mimic cognitive decline
- How long could someone sustain this kind of gaslighting before the victim or someone else catches on?
- Legal aspects: what power does a spouse have over medical decisions? How hard is it to commit someone?
- Claire needs a specific skill set—medical knowledge? Psychology background? Acting training?
- The house should almost be a character—modern but cold, beautiful but hostile
- Consider: Emma's chapters get more fragmented/unreliable as book progresses, Claire's get more clear OR Claire's get more unhinged
- Chapters could be titled with dates/times showing Emma's time loss (chapter says "Monday" but it's actually Thursday)
- Found documents: emails, texts, journal entries that contradict narration
- Final image: which woman is standing, which woman is gone, which woman won (if anyone)

**Remember: This is a junk pile. It's supposed to be messy. You're not writing the story yet—you're just unloading the chaos so the real story has somewhere to land.**
