# Chapter 2
## EMMA

The gallery was called Tate Contemporary. My name, or the name I took when I married David. Before that it was Emma Morrison Contemporary, but Morrison didn't have the same ring. David said Tate sounded established. Serious. Like a real institution.

I'm trying to remember the artists I represented. There was someone who worked in reclaimed metal. And a photographer, young guy, did landscapes but weird ones, distorted. And a woman who painted faces that looked like they were melting. What were their names?

I'm sitting in the living room with my laptop open, searching my own gallery. The website is still up but it says "Closed until further notice" in red letters across the top. When did I close it? I try to think back. Six months feels right, but six months ago is a blank space. Before that is clearer—openings, installations, emails, negotiations. After that is fog.

I find a news article: "Beloved Local Gallery Closes Due to Owner's Health Issues." The photo shows me standing in front of a massive canvas, smiling, a wine glass in my hand. I look alive in that photo. Present.

The article is from February. It's July now. Five months. But I thought Claire said six months. Or did she say five? Do I remember her saying anything specific at all, or am I filling in blanks?

My phone rings. The sound makes me flinch—when did I become someone who flinches at phone calls?

Kate. My sister.

I answer before I can think about whether I'm ready for this conversation. "Hey."

"Emma, thank God. I've been trying to reach you all week." Kate sounds stressed. She always sounds stressed now when she talks to me. "Did you get my messages?"

"I—maybe? I'm sorry. I might have missed them."

"Might have missed them." She lets out a sharp breath. "Em, we talked three days ago. You said you'd call me back Tuesday. It's Friday."

Three days ago. Tuesday. I try to pull up the memory and get nothing. Just absence.

"I'm sorry," I say again, because what else is there to say?

"It's okay. It's fine. I'm not—look, I'm not mad. I'm worried." Her voice softens. "How are you doing? How was the doctor appointment?"

"It was fine. Dr. Chen says the progression is consistent."

"Consistent with what?"

"With what they've been seeing."

"That doesn't mean anything, Emma."

"I know."

Kate is quiet for a moment. Then: "Are you taking care of yourself? Are you eating?"

"Yes."

"Is David there? Is he helping?"

"He's at work. Claire is here."

"The home health aide."

"Companion." I don't know why I correct her. Claire isn't really a companion. She's more like a supervisor. A warden. "She's nice."

"You don't sound convinced."

I stand up and walk to the window. The living room looks out over the back yard—two acres of landscaped lawn, mature trees, a stone patio with furniture we never use. Beyond that, woods. We're isolated out here. Twenty minutes from town. No neighbors within sight.

"Emma?" Kate's voice pulls me back. "You still there?"

"Yeah. Sorry."

"Talk to me. What's going on?"

Everything. Nothing. I'm losing my mind and everyone's watching it happen. I'm writing notes to myself that I can't find. I'm living in a house that feels wrong in ways I can't articulate.

"I'm just tired," I say.

"Have you thought any more about coming to stay with us? You and Michael and the kids. Just for a little while."

We've had this conversation before. I'm almost certain we've had this conversation before. "David needs me here."

"David needs help. You need help. Professional help, Em. Not just a home health aide."

"I'm seeing Dr. Chen."

"I mean like a facility. A place with real resources, with specialists who—"

"I'm not going to a home, Kate."

"I didn't say a home. I said a facility. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

She's quiet again. I can hear noise in the background—her kids, probably. A whole life happening behind her, normal and loud and real.

"I'm coming to visit next week," she says finally. "I'm going to drive up Thursday. We'll spend the day together. Just us. Okay?"

"Okay."

"And Emma? If something feels wrong—if you're scared, or if you need help—you can tell me. You know that, right?"

Something in her voice makes my chest tighten. Like she already knows. Like she's waiting for me to admit it.

"I'm fine," I say.

"Right. Fine." She doesn't believe me. "Okay. I'll see you Thursday."

After we hang up, I stand at the window and try to figure out what day it is. She said it's Friday. But which Friday? And what happened to Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?

I hear footsteps on the stairs. Claire, moving through the house. I wonder what she does all day when she's not watching me. I wonder if she goes through my things. I wonder what she reports back to David.

The thought comes unbidden: I wonder if she's looking for something.

I turn away from the window and nearly trip over the coffee table. It's in the wrong place. I'm sure it's in the wrong place. It used to be further from the couch, didn't it? Or maybe it's always been here and I'm misremembering. I push it with my foot, trying to find where it looks right, but everywhere looks wrong.

"Emma?" Claire appears in the doorway. "Everything okay?"

"The furniture's different."

"Different how?"

"It's not where it should be."

She walks into the room and looks around with a small frown. "It looks the same to me. Has it been moved recently?"

"I don't know. Maybe. Or maybe not." I can hear how I sound. Uncertain. Confused. Wrong.

"Do you want me to help you move it?" she asks gently.

"No. It's fine. I'm just—it's fine."

She nods slowly. "Okay. Well, I was going to make lunch. Are you hungry?"

"Not really."

"You should eat something. David mentioned you haven't been eating much."

David mentioned. David says. David thinks. Everything filtered through him.

"I'll eat later," I say.

"How about I make something light? Soup and crackers?" She's already moving toward the kitchen, not really giving me a choice.

I follow her because I don't know what else to do. The kitchen still feels like a magazine spread—gleaming and perfect and not quite real. Claire pulls ingredients from the refrigerator with easy familiarity. She knows where everything is. She's been here six months and she knows this kitchen better than I do.

"Can I ask you something?" I say.

"Of course." She's chopping vegetables, efficient and precise.

"What did David tell you about me? When he hired you?"

Her hands slow but don't stop. "He said you were dealing with early-onset cognitive decline. That you needed help managing day-to-day tasks. That you were having trouble with memory and sometimes with spatial awareness."

"Spatial awareness."

"Balance. Navigation. Things like that."

"What else?"

"He said you'd been an art dealer. That you were brilliant at it. He showed me some photos from your gallery openings." She glances at me. "You looked happy."

Past tense. Looked happy. Was brilliant.

"Did he say anything about me being paranoid?"

She sets down the knife and turns to face me fully. "Why do you ask?"

"I just wondered what he told you to expect."

"He said you might be suspicious sometimes. That it's part of the condition. That I shouldn't take it personally." Her voice is careful, measured. "Are you suspicious of me, Emma?"

"I don't know. Should I be?"

She holds my gaze for a long moment. Something flickers in her expression—surprise, maybe, or respect. "No," she says finally. "You shouldn't be."

"But I am."

"Why?"

Because you watch me. Because you take notes. Because you appeared in my life right when everything started falling apart and I can't remember deciding to hire you or even meeting you for the first time.

"I don't know," I say instead.

She turns back to the vegetables. "For what it's worth, I'm here to help. That's all."

"That's what everyone says."

The soup is tomato basil. She serves it in white bowls with crackers on the side and we eat at the kitchen island in silence. The soup is good. I tell her so and she smiles briefly and says thank you.

Afterward, she says she needs to pick up some things from the store and asks if I need anything. I say no. She tells me she'll be back in an hour and reminds me to take my afternoon pills and leaves.

The house is quiet without her. I stand in the kitchen and listen to the silence. It's not peaceful. It's waiting.

I go upstairs to the bathroom. I need to check again. Maybe I missed the note. Maybe I put it in a different spot.

The tile behind the toilet is still loose. I press it, pull it forward, reach behind. Nothing.

I check every tile in the bathroom. Press, pull, reach. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

I'm on my knees on the bathroom floor when I notice the grout line between two tiles near the baseboard. It looks darker than the others. Like something is wedged in there.

I use my fingernail to pry at it. A small piece of folded paper comes loose.

Not the same note. This one is older, the paper almost fuzzy. My handwriting again, but shakier.

CLAIRE IS WATCHING.

Four words this time. A different warning, or an extension of the first.

I stare at it. Try to remember writing it. Try to remember what I meant.

Claire is watching. Yes. I knew that. She's supposed to be watching. That's her job.

But this feels different. This feels like a warning, not an observation.

I think about her in the kitchen just now. The way she moved through the space. The way she knew where everything was. The way she asked me if I was suspicious of her, like she'd been waiting for the question.

What is she watching for?

I fold the note smaller and smaller until it's a tiny square and I tuck it into my bra because that's the only place I can think of that no one searches. Then I stand up and look at myself in the mirror.

I look like someone who hides notes in their underwear because they don't trust anyone.

I look like my mother did, near the end. Scared. Scattered. Lost.

Is that what's happening to me? Is this what it looks like from the inside—convinced everyone's against you when really you're just sick?

Or am I right to be afraid?

The front door opens downstairs. Claire's back already. That wasn't an hour.

"Emma?" she calls up. "You okay?"

"Fine," I call back. "Just washing my hands."

I run the water. Look at my face in the mirror one more time. Try to see myself clearly.

But all I see is someone who can't trust her own mind.

And maybe that's the most dangerous thing of all.
