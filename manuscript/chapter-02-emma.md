# Chapter 2
## EMMA

The gallery was called Lumina.

Or was it Luminance?

I'm sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee I don't remember making, trying to hold onto the memory of my old life. The life before the forgetting. Before David started watching me like I might shatter at any moment. Before pills and episodes and locked doors.

I ran an art gallery. I'm sure of that much. Contemporary pieces, mostly. Local artists breaking into the scene. I can almost see the white walls, the track lighting, the way certain paintings seemed to glow against the blank canvas of space.

But when I try to remember the name, it slips away. Lumina. Luminance. Luminary?

The harder I grasp, the more it dissolves.

"You're thinking too hard again."

I jolt, coffee sloshing over the rim of my mug. Claire stands in the doorway—when did she arrive? I didn't hear her come in, didn't hear footsteps or keys or the front door opening. She's just suddenly there, like she materialized from air.

Claire. David's solution to my "condition." A live-in health companion, he called her. Someone to help with daily tasks, to keep an eye on me when he's working, to make sure I don't burn down the house or wander into traffic or forget to eat.

She's younger than me—maybe late twenties?—with dark hair pulled into a neat ponytail and eyes that never seem to blink. She wears scrubs even though she's not a nurse. Navy blue today. Or have they always been navy blue?

"I wasn't thinking," I say, wiping at the spilled coffee with my sleeve. "Just... remembering."

"Your gallery." It's not a question. Claire moves into the kitchen with the kind of quiet efficiency that makes me feel loud and clumsy by comparison. She takes a dish towel from the drawer—the right drawer, I notice, without having to search—and hands it to me. "Lumina Gallery on Fifth Street. You ran it for eleven years before you had to step down."

Eleven years. Fifth Street. Why can I remember the texture of gallery walls but not its exact name or location?

"How do you know that?" I ask.

"You told me." She's already turning away, opening the refrigerator, pulling out ingredients I didn't know we had. "Last week. And the week before that. You tell me a lot of things, Emma, and then you forget you've told me."

The way she says it—flat, matter-of-fact—makes something in my chest tighten. Is that pity in her voice? Judgment? I can't tell. I can never tell with Claire.

"What was I like?" The question slips out before I can stop it. "Before. When I ran the gallery. What was I like?"

Claire pauses, an egg suspended between refrigerator and counter. For a moment I think she won't answer. Then: "Confident. Sharp. You knew what you wanted and how to get it. David showed me photos once. You looked... different."

Different. The kindest word for diminished.

My phone buzzes on the table—Kate's name flashing across the screen. My sister. I should be happy to see her calling, but instead I feel a creeping dread. Kate's calls always leave me feeling worse, though I can't quite remember why.

I answer anyway. "Hello?"

"Em! Finally. I've been trying to reach you all morning."

Have you? I check the phone log, but the screen is smudged, hard to read. Did she call? Did I miss it? Did I answer and forget?

"Sorry, I was—" I glance at Claire, who's cracking eggs into a bowl with mechanical precision. "Busy."

"How are you feeling?" Kate's voice has that particular quality I've come to recognize. Concern wrapped in caution, like she's approaching a wild animal that might bolt. "David said you had a rough day yesterday."

David talked to Kate about me. When? What did he tell her?

"I'm fine," I say automatically. "Really. Just a little foggy, that's all."

"A little foggy." Kate sighs, and I can picture her perfectly—sitting in her sunny kitchen two hours away, phone wedged between shoulder and ear, probably packing lunches for her kids. My nieces. What are their names again? The older one is... Sarah? Sophie? The younger one...

I can't remember my nieces' names.

"Emma, you called me at 3 AM last week and asked if I'd seen your mother. Mom's been dead for four years."

The words hit like a slap. I called her? I don't remember. But that doesn't mean anything anymore. I don't remember lots of things.

"I'm sorry," I whisper.

"I'm not mad, Em. I'm worried. We're all worried. Have you thought anymore about what David suggested? About the care facility he found? It's supposed to be really nice—"

"No." The word comes out sharper than I intended. "I'm not going to one of those places. I'm not Mom."

"Nobody's saying you are. But you need more help than David and Claire can provide. You're getting worse, and—"

"I have to go." I can feel Claire watching me from across the kitchen, her hands still moving through the motions of cooking but her attention fixed on me like a spotlight. "Kate, I really have to go."

"Emma—"

I end the call before she can finish. My hands are shaking. Care facility. David suggested a care facility. When? Why don't I remember that conversation?

The phone buzzes again—Kate calling back—but I silence it. I can't handle her worry right now, her gentle suggestions that feel like giving up. I'm only thirty-eight. Too young for this. Too young to be losing myself piece by piece.

"You shouldn't cut her off like that." Claire sets a plate in front of me. Scrambled eggs, toast, orange slices arranged in a careful fan. Food I didn't ask for, prepared while I was distracted. "She's trying to help."

"Everyone's trying to help," I mutter, poking at the eggs with my fork. "Somehow I just keep getting worse."

"That's not how dementia works. Help doesn't make it go away. It just makes the decline more manageable."

Dementia. The word hangs in the air between us, heavy and final. Is that what this is? Have the doctors actually said that word, or is it just the assumption we're all dancing around?

I can't remember.

"My mother had it," I say quietly. "Early-onset. She started showing symptoms at forty-two."

"I know. David told me."

Of course he did. David tells Claire everything. They have whole conversations about me, about my condition, about what to do with the woman I used to be.

I eat the eggs because it's easier than arguing. They're good—fluffy, seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper and maybe a touch of something else I can't identify. Claire is a good cook. Better than me, certainly. I can barely remember how to make coffee anymore.

"Did I used to cook?" I ask between bites.

"You did. David said you made elaborate dinners when you were first married. Four-course meals. You liked to experiment with recipes from different countries."

Italy, I think. We went to Italy for our honeymoon. Or was it Greece? I can see blue water, white buildings, David's hand in mine as we climbed stone steps that seemed ancient and eternal. But I can't place the country. Can't remember if it was our honeymoon or just a vacation or a dream I've confused with reality.

When did we get married? How long have we been together?

I should know this.

I should know my own history.

"Emma?" Claire leans forward, studying my face. "You're doing it again. Going away."

"I'm right here."

"No, you're not. You're somewhere else. Somewhere I can't follow."

The way she says it—*somewhere I can't follow*—sends a chill down my spine. There's something in her tone. Not quite sympathy. Not quite curiosity. Something sharper. More observant.

"Do you watch me?" The question tumbles out before I can think better of it. "When I'm 'going away,' as you put it. Do you watch?"

Claire doesn't answer immediately. She gathers my empty plate, carries it to the sink, runs water over the ceramic. "It's my job to watch you. To keep you safe."

"That's not what I mean."

She turns, water still running behind her, and for just a moment her expression shifts. Something flickers across her face—knowledge? Guilt? Satisfaction?—before the professional mask slides back into place.

"I watch you," she says carefully, "because David pays me to watch you. Because you can't be trusted to watch yourself. Because last week you left the stove on for three hours and nearly burned down the kitchen. So yes, Emma. I watch you. Every minute of every day."

The words should comfort me. That's the arrangement, after all. That's why she's here.

So why do they feel like a threat?

I push back from the table, need sudden space, need air that doesn't feel thick with observation. "I'm going to lie down."

"Your medication—"

"I took it this morning." Did I? Yes, David gave it to me. Two pills with water. White and blue. "I'm fine."

But I'm not fine, and we both know it. I make it halfway up the stairs before the fog rolls in again, that cotton-thick confusion that makes me forget why I'm climbing, where I'm going, what I was doing before this moment.

I grip the banister and count.

One. Kitchen to stairs.
Two. Stairs to second floor.
Three. Second floor to...

The bathroom. I was going to the bathroom. To look for the note again. The note I may or may not have found this morning. The note that may or may not be real.

But when I reach the bathroom, something stops me cold.

There's a piece of paper taped to the mirror.

My handwriting again. Hasty, urgent, the pen pressed hard enough to tear through in one spot.

Four words this time:

CLAIRE IS WATCHING YOU.

My breath catches. I turn, half-expecting to find her standing behind me, but the hallway is empty. The house is silent except for the distant sound of running water—Claire, still in the kitchen, washing dishes.

I pull the note from the mirror, my hands shaking so hard the paper rattles. This is real. This is actual paper, actual ink. I'm holding it. I can feel it.

When did I write this? This morning? Yesterday? A week ago?

And why don't I remember?

I start to fold it, to hide it somewhere safe, but then I freeze. Where? Where did I hide the last one? Think, Emma. Think.

But my mind is blank. A white wall with no paintings, no memory, no reference point.

I could show it to David. Say: Look, I found this, what does it mean? But something stops me. The note says not to trust him. This note says Claire is watching.

Both notes are warnings.

Both notes suggest I'm in danger.

Or both notes are evidence of a deteriorating mind creating conspiracies where none exist.

I fold the paper into a small square and slip it into my pocket. I'll decide later what to do with it. Later, when my head is clearer. Later, when I can trust myself to remember.

Downstairs, the water shuts off. Footsteps cross the kitchen floor—deliberate, measured, heading toward the stairs.

Coming toward me.

I flush the toilet for cover, run the sink, try to look casual as I dry my hands. When I step into the hallway, Claire is at the bottom of the stairs, looking up.

Looking right at me.

"Everything okay?" she asks.

"Fine."

"You were up there a long time."

How long? I have no sense of it. Could have been five minutes or fifty.

"I'm tired," I say. "I think I'll rest."

Claire nods, but she doesn't move. Just stands there, watching me with those unblinking eyes, and I have the sudden, irrational conviction that she knows. Knows about the note in my pocket. Knows about the note I found this morning. Knows about every thought in my fragmenting mind.

"Call if you need anything," she finally says.

I nod and walk past her to the bedroom, feeling her gaze track my movement like a camera.

Inside, I lock the door—or try to. The lock sticks, doesn't quite catch. When did that happen? Was it always broken?

I sink onto the bed and pull out the note, smoothing it flat against my thigh.

CLAIRE IS WATCHING YOU.

I believe myself. The past version of me who wrote this—I believe her.

I just don't know what to do about it.

I slip the note under my pillow and close my eyes, exhausted by the effort of existing in my own unreliable mind.

Sleep comes quickly, pulling me under like dark water.

When I wake, the light through the windows has changed. Hours have passed. The note is gone from under my pillow.

And I can't remember if I dreamed the whole thing.
