# Chapter 2
## EMMA

The gallery was called Lumina.

I'm sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee I don't remember making, trying to hold onto facts about my old life. The life before I started forgetting everything. Before David started watching me every second like I might do something dangerous. Before the pills and the episodes and the constant feeling that I'm losing my grip on reality.

I ran an art gallery. That much I know for sure. Contemporary pieces. Local artists. I can picture the space—white walls, high ceilings, track lighting that could be adjusted to spotlight specific pieces. There was a reception desk near the front. A small office in the back where I handled paperwork and made phone calls to collectors.

Lumina Gallery. On Fifth Street. David told me that yesterday. Or was it this morning? He said it with such certainty that I wrote it down on a napkin so I wouldn't forget.

Except now I can't find the napkin.

I search the kitchen table, moving aside my coffee cup, checking under my placemat, looking in the chair where I'm sitting. Nothing. Did I throw it away? Did I imagine writing it down? Or did David tell me the gallery name at all?

I press my palms against my eyes until I see stars. This is what every day is like now. Grasping at information that dissolves the moment I try to hold onto it.

"You're thinking too hard again."

The voice makes me jump. Coffee sloshes over the rim of my mug and onto the table. I didn't hear anyone come in. Didn't hear the front door or footsteps or any indication that I'm not alone.

Claire is standing in the kitchen doorway. She's wearing navy blue scrubs and white sneakers. Her dark hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's maybe twenty-nine or thirty. Pretty in an unremarkable way. The kind of person you could pass on the street and not remember five minutes later.

Except Claire is always here. Always watching. Always appearing in rooms without warning.

"I was just..." I gesture vaguely at my coffee cup. "Trying to remember something."

"Your gallery." Claire walks into the kitchen with the kind of quiet efficiency that makes me feel clumsy and loud. She goes straight to the right drawer—not searching, not hesitating, just knowing exactly where things are in my house—and pulls out a dish towel. "You're trying to remember the name."

How does she know that? Did I say it out loud? Or can she read my mind now?

Claire wipes up the spilled coffee without being asked. Her movements are quick and precise. When she's done, she goes to the refrigerator and starts pulling out ingredients. Eggs. Butter. Cheese. Vegetables I don't remember buying.

"Lumina Gallery," she says, her back to me as she works. "On Fifth Street downtown. You ran it for eleven years before you had to step down. You specialized in contemporary art, mostly local artists trying to break into the bigger galleries. You were known for having a good eye. For taking risks on artists other galleries wouldn't touch."

The information sounds right. I think it's right. But I'm not sure if I actually remember these facts or if I'm just accepting Claire's version of my history because I don't have access to my own.

"How do you know all that?" I ask.

She cracks an egg into a bowl. "You told me. Last week. And the week before that. You tell me a lot of things, Emma. Then you forget you've told me. Then you tell me again."

The way she says it—flat, emotionless—makes me feel like I'm a broken record. Saying the same things over and over, asking the same questions, living the same confused day on repeat.

"What else did I tell you?" I ask.

Claire pauses. Turns to look at me. Her expression is carefully neutral. "What do you mean?"

"What else do I say? When I'm telling you things. What do I talk about?"

She considers this for a moment. Then she turns back to the eggs. "Mostly the gallery. Sometimes your sister. Sometimes you ask me about David—where he is, what he's doing, how long we've been married. You ask a lot of questions about the house. You say it feels wrong. Like the layout has changed."

"Has it changed?"

"No. The house is exactly the same as it's always been. You've lived here for six years."

Six years. I should know that. Should remember moving in, remember unpacking boxes, remember making this place a home. But when I try to access those memories, there's nothing. Just blank space where the past should be.

"You also ask about your medication," Claire continues. She's whisking eggs now, adding milk, her movements methodical. "What the pills are for. Why you're taking them. Whether they're helping."

"Are they helping?"

"I don't know. That's a question for your doctor."

But there's something in her tone. Something that makes me think she has an opinion about the medication even if she won't say it out loud.

My phone buzzes on the table. Kate's name appears on the screen. My sister. I should want to talk to her. Should be happy to see her calling. But instead I feel a wave of dread wash over me.

I don't know why. Can't remember the last time we talked or what we talked about. Just this vague sense that conversations with Kate leave me feeling worse than before.

I answer anyway. "Hello?"

"Em! Finally. I've been trying to reach you all morning."

Have you? I look at my phone, trying to see if there are missed calls, but the screen is smudged and difficult to read. I don't remember Kate calling. But that doesn't mean anything anymore.

"Sorry," I say. "I was... busy."

It's a lie. I wasn't busy. I was sitting here trying to remember the name of my own gallery. But I don't want to tell Kate that. Don't want to give her more evidence of how far I've declined.

"How are you feeling?" Kate's voice has that particular quality I've come to recognize. Concern mixed with caution. Like she's trying to be supportive but also bracing herself for bad news. "David said you had a rough day yesterday."

David talked to Kate. About me. When did that happen? What did he tell her?

I glance at Claire, who's still cooking but I can tell she's listening. Even with her back to me, even focused on the stove, she's paying attention to every word I say.

"I'm fine," I tell Kate. "Really. Just a little foggy."

"A little foggy." Kate sighs, and I can picture her so clearly. Sitting in her bright, clean kitchen two hours away. Probably packing lunches for her kids. My nieces. What are their names? I should know my own nieces' names.

The older one is... Sarah? Sophie? Sara?

The younger one is...

I can't remember. Can't access that information. It's there somewhere in my broken brain but I can't reach it.

"Emma, you called me at 3 AM last week and asked if I'd seen Mom. Mom's been dead for four years."

The words hit me like cold water. I called Kate in the middle of the night? I asked about our dead mother? I don't remember any of that. Don't remember picking up the phone or dialing her number or having a conversation.

"I'm sorry," I whisper.

"I'm not trying to make you feel bad, Em. I'm just... worried. We're all worried. Have you thought anymore about what David suggested? About that care facility he found? The one in Chester? He said it's supposed to be really nice. They specialize in early-onset cases. You'd have your own room, and I could visit every week, and—"

"No." The word comes out sharper than I intended. "I'm not going to one of those places."

"It's not like where Mom was. This is different. They have activities and therapy and—"

"I said no."

There's a pause. I can hear Kate breathing on the other end of the line. Can hear the disappointment in her silence.

"You're getting worse, Emma. You need more help than David and Claire can provide. You need professional care."

Professional care. That's code for giving up. For admitting I can't function anymore. For letting myself be warehoused somewhere while I slowly forget who I am.

Like my mother. Who spent three years in a facility not knowing she had a daughter. Who died not recognizing her own family.

"I have to go," I say.

"Emma, please don't hang up. We need to talk about this. David is doing his best but he can't—"

I end the call. My hand is shaking. The phone buzzes immediately—Kate calling back—but I silence it. I can't handle her worry right now. Can't handle the gentle suggestion that I'm too broken to be helped at home.

I'm thirty-eight years old. That's too young for a care facility. Too young to give up. Too young to accept that this is how the rest of my life will be.

"You shouldn't cut her off like that." Claire sets a plate in front of me. Scrambled eggs, toast, orange slices arranged in a careful fan pattern. "She's trying to help."

"Everyone's trying to help," I say, poking at the eggs with my fork. "Somehow I just keep getting worse."

"That's not how dementia works. Help doesn't make it go away. It just makes the decline more manageable."

Dementia. There it is again. That word. The word everyone dances around but never says directly to my face. Except Claire. Claire says it like it's a fact. Like my diagnosis is settled and I should just accept it.

"Do I have dementia?" I ask.

Claire pauses. Looks at me. "Hasn't your doctor told you?"

"I don't remember what my doctor told me. I don't remember most of my appointments. That's why I'm asking you."

She considers this. Then says, "David says the doctors are still running tests. They haven't given you a definitive diagnosis yet. But the symptoms point toward early-onset dementia. Like your mother had."

My mother. There it is again. The comparison everyone makes but nobody finishes. My mother who forgot me. My mother who died not knowing she had a family. My mother who spent her final years in a fog of confusion and fear.

"My mother started showing symptoms at forty-two," I say quietly. "I'm thirty-eight."

"Sometimes it starts earlier in subsequent generations. That's what David told me."

David told her. David tells her everything. They have whole conversations about me. About my condition. About my future. Conversations I'm not part of because I can't be trusted to participate in discussions about my own life.

I eat the eggs because it's easier than arguing. They're good. Fluffy and seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper and maybe something else I can't identify. Claire is a better cook than I am. Better at most things than I am these days.

"Did I use to cook?" I ask.

Claire nods. "David said you used to make elaborate dinners when you were first married. Four-course meals. You experimented with recipes from different countries. Italian. Thai. French. You liked trying new things."

I try to summon a memory of cooking. Of standing at this stove, making complicated meals, presenting beautiful plates to David. But there's nothing. Just another blank space where my past should be.

"When did we get married?" I ask. "David and me. How long ago?"

"Six years. You got married in June. Had the wedding at a vineyard upstate. David showed me photos once."

Six years. June. A vineyard. These should be facts I know without having to ask. Should be memories I can access automatically. But they might as well be someone else's history.

"Did I love him?" The question surprises me as much as it probably surprises Claire. "When we got married. Was I in love with him?"

Claire's expression doesn't change. "I wasn't there, Emma. I don't know what you felt six years ago."

"But you've seen the photos. You've talked to David. Based on that, do you think I loved him?"

She's quiet for a long moment. Then: "I think David believes you loved him. Whether that's the same thing, I can't say."

It's a strange answer. Careful. Like she's choosing her words with precision to avoid saying something she's not supposed to say.

"Do you watch me?" I ask. The question comes from somewhere I don't fully understand. Some instinct I don't trust anymore.

"What do you mean?"

"When I'm having episodes. When I'm 'going away,' as David puts it. Do you watch? Do you take notes?"

Claire picks up my empty plate. Carries it to the sink. Runs water over the ceramic. "It's my job to watch you. To keep you safe. To document any changes in your behavior so the doctors can track your progression."

"That's not what I mean."

She turns off the water. Turns to face me. For just a moment, something flickers across her face. Something I can't quite read. Then it's gone, replaced by her usual professional mask.

"I watch you," she says slowly, "because that's what David pays me to do. Because you can't be trusted to watch yourself. Because last week you left the stove on for three hours and nearly burned down the kitchen. Because the week before that you walked out the front door in your pajamas and didn't remember where you were going. So yes, Emma. I watch you. Every minute of every day. That's my job."

The words should make me feel safe. Protected. That's the whole point of having Claire here, after all. Someone to watch me when I can't watch myself.

So why does it feel like a threat?

I push back from the table. Need space. Need air. Need to be somewhere that doesn't feel so observed.

"I'm going to lie down," I say.

"Your medication—"

"I took it this morning. David gave it to me." Did he? Yes. Two pills. White and blue. I remember swallowing them. At least I think I do.

"Okay. Let me know if you need anything."

I leave the kitchen before she can say anything else. Before she can offer more help I don't want. Before I have to see that carefully neutral expression that makes me feel like a specimen being studied.

I make it halfway up the stairs before the fog rolls in again. That thick, cotton-wool confusion that makes me forget why I'm climbing. Where I'm going. What I was doing five seconds ago.

I grip the banister and count. Force myself to remember.

I was going upstairs. To my bedroom. To lie down.

No. Not just to lie down. I was going to... what? Look for something? Check something?

The thought is there but I can't quite catch it. It slips away before I can fully form it.

I continue up the stairs. Reach the second floor. Stand in the hallway trying to decide what to do next.

The bathroom. Something about the bathroom. Something I need to check.

I go into the bathroom and look around. The medicine cabinet. The shelf above the toilet with the books. The books I was... what? Reading? Hiding something between?

I pull the books off the shelf. Flip through them. Check between the pages. Nothing.

What was I looking for?

I can't remember. Can't hold onto the thought long enough to make sense of it.

But then I notice something. There's a piece of paper taped to the bathroom mirror. A small note. My handwriting.

Four words this time: CLAIRE IS WATCHING YOU.

My breath catches. I stare at the note, my heart hammering. When did I write this? This morning? Yesterday? Five minutes ago?

I turn around, half expecting to find Claire standing behind me. But the hallway is empty. The house is quiet except for the sound of running water downstairs. Claire washing dishes.

I pull the note off the mirror, careful not to tear it. The tape comes away with a small ripping sound. I smooth the paper flat against the counter.

CLAIRE IS WATCHING YOU.

This is real. Actual paper, actual ink. I can feel it between my fingers. Can see my handwriting—those looping Ts, that slight right slant.

But I don't remember writing it.

Don't remember taping it to the mirror.

Don't remember when or why I felt the need to leave myself this warning.

I fold the note into a small square. Need to hide it. Need to keep it safe. But where?

Where did I hide the other one? The one from this morning? Or was it yesterday morning? When did I find that first note?

The memories are jumbled. Out of order. I remember finding a note. Something about not trusting someone. About hiding it between books. Or in the medicine cabinet. Or...

I can't remember. Can't piece together the sequence of events.

I slip the note into my pocket. I'll hide it later. When I can think more clearly. When I can trust myself to remember where I put it.

The water downstairs shuts off. Footsteps cross the kitchen floor. Heading toward the stairs.

Coming toward me.

I flush the toilet even though I haven't used it. Run the sink. Try to look like I was doing something normal. Something other than finding mysterious notes in my own handwriting.

When I step into the hallway, Claire is at the bottom of the stairs. Looking up at me with those dark, unblinking eyes.

"Everything okay?" she asks.

"Fine. Just tired."

"You were up there a long time."

How long? I have no sense of it. Could have been five minutes or fifty. Time is meaningless when you can't track it properly.

"I think I'll rest," I say.

Claire nods but doesn't move. Just stands there watching me. And I have the sudden, irrational conviction that she knows. Knows about the note in my pocket. Knows about the other notes. Knows every thought in my fragmenting mind.

"Call if you need anything," she finally says.

I walk past her to the bedroom, feeling her gaze track my movement like a security camera.

Inside the bedroom, I try to lock the door. The lock sticks. Doesn't quite catch. I jiggle the handle, try again, but it won't engage properly. When did that break? Was it always broken?

I give up and sit on the edge of the bed, pulling out the note.

CLAIRE IS WATCHING YOU.

I believe myself. The past version of me who wrote this—whoever she was, whenever she was—I believe her.

I just don't know what to do about it.

I look around the room for a hiding place. The mattress? The closet? The dresser drawers?

Wherever I put it, I'll probably forget. Just like I forgot about the first note. Just like I'm forgetting everything else.

I slip the note under my pillow for now. Just temporarily. Just until I can think of somewhere better.

Then I lie down and close my eyes, exhausted by the effort of trying to hold onto reality when reality keeps shifting beneath me.

Sleep comes quickly. Pulls me under like I'm drowning.

When I wake up, the light through the windows has changed. The angle is different. Sharper. Later in the day.

How much later? I have no idea.

I reach under my pillow, my heart already sinking.

The note is gone.

I check under all the pillows. Under the mattress. Between the sheets. In the pillowcases.

Nothing.

It's gone. Just like the first one. Just like everything else I try to hold onto.

I sit on the bed, trying not to cry, trying not to let the frustration and fear overwhelm me completely.

Did I dream it? Did I imagine finding the note? Or was it real and now it's been taken?

I don't know. Can't know. My own mind has become an unreliable witness to my own life.

The only thing I'm certain of is this: something is wrong. Something beyond just my failing memory. Something that leaves me warnings I can't remember. Something that makes me question everyone around me, including myself.

And the worst part is, I don't know if I'm going crazy or if I'm finally seeing the truth.
