# Chapter 3
## EMMA

I'm standing in the kitchen holding a knife and I can't remember what to do with it.

There's a chicken on the cutting board in front of me. Whole. Raw. Pink skin pulled tight over the carcass. It's sitting there like an accusation, like it's waiting for me to remember something I should know how to do.

Dinner. I'm supposed to be making dinner. I know this because David mentioned it—when? This morning? Yesterday? He said something about having his mother over. Or did I offer to cook? I can't remember the conversation. Can't remember agreeing to this. But here I am, standing over a dead bird with a knife in my hand and absolutely no idea what comes next.

The knife is heavy. Chef's knife, eight inches, German steel. I know these facts about the knife but I don't know what to do with it. Do I cut the chicken into pieces? Do I stuff it with something? Does it go in the oven whole? The information should be automatic—I've cooked chicken hundreds of times, haven't I?—but when I reach for the memory, there's nothing there. Just empty space where the knowledge should be.

I set the knife down carefully. My hands are shaking. This is what every day is like now. Standing in the middle of ordinary tasks and suddenly realizing I have no idea how to complete them. Making coffee and forgetting how many scoops of grounds. Getting dressed and not remembering which clothes go on first. Brushing my teeth and staring at the toothbrush like it's a foreign object.

The kitchen feels wrong too. I can't put my finger on exactly what's different, but something is off. The counters seem too high. Or maybe too low. I can't decide which. The island in the center of the room is white marble with gray veining, but I have this nagging feeling it should be darker. Granite maybe. Or that warm butcher block wood that David said was too impractical. Except I don't remember having that conversation. Don't remember choosing this marble.

The stove has six burners. I count them. One, two, three, four, five, six. That's too many, isn't it? Our old stove had four burners. I'm certain of it. Two in front, two in back. This stove is massive, professional-grade, the kind you see in restaurant kitchens. When did we get this stove?

"Would you like help?"

The voice makes me jump. The knife I set down clatters against the cutting board. Claire is standing right next to me—I didn't hear her come in, didn't notice her approaching—and she's looking at the chicken with an expression I can't quite read.

"I can do it," I say. But we both know it's a lie. I've been staring at this chicken for—how long? Five minutes? Ten? I have no idea.

"It's already four-thirty." Claire doesn't move to take over, doesn't reach for the knife. Just stands there with that maddening patience. "David will be home at six. He said his mother is joining you for dinner."

Helen. David's mother. Right. I remember now. Or do I? Did David tell me Helen was coming, or did Claire just tell me?

"I can make dinner for my own family," I say. The words come out sharper than I intended. More defensive. "I've been cooking for twenty years. I don't need help with a simple chicken."

But even as I'm saying it, I'm staring at the raw poultry and my mind is completely blank. Season it? Stuff it? Cut it into pieces? Roast it whole at... what temperature? The steps should be obvious, automatic, but they're just gone. Erased from my memory like they were never there at all.

Claire waits. She's good at waiting. Patient in a way that makes me feel like a child who needs to be gently corrected. Three seconds pass—I count them—and then she reaches out and takes the knife from my hand.

"Why don't you set the table?" she suggests. Her voice is kind but there's something underneath it. Pity? Satisfaction? "The plates are in the cabinet to the left of the sink."

The left of the sink. Easy enough.

I open the cabinet to the left of the sink and find only glasses. Rows of glasses. Tumblers and wine glasses and champagne flutes. No plates.

"The other left," Claire says quietly.

My face goes hot. Left and right. I mixed up left and right. When did that start happening? When did basic directions become something I have to think about?

I open the other cabinet—the right cabinet, which is on the left side of the sink, or is it the right side?—and find the plates. White porcelain with a thin gold rim. I take out four plates because Helen is coming. Four people need four plates. At least I can still count.

I carry the plates to the dining room, moving slowly, carefully, like I'm walking on ice. The dining room table is enormous. Dark wood, maybe mahogany, seats eight people comfortably. It dominates the room, this massive piece of furniture that seems to be trying to make a statement about wealth or status or something I don't understand.

But I don't remember this table. I remember a smaller table. Round. Light wood. There was a crack in the surface near one edge where I'd set down a hot pan without a trivet. David had been annoyed but said he'd get it fixed. We never did fix it. The crack became part of the table, a reminder to be more careful.

Except that table isn't here. This table is here. Huge and expensive and perfect. No cracks. No history. Just a beautiful piece of furniture that might as well belong to someone else.

"Emma?"

I turn and Helen is standing in the doorway. When did she arrive? Did I hear the doorbell? Did David let her in? Or does she have a key?

Helen lives in the guest house behind the main property. That's what David told me. Or what Claire told me. Someone told me that Helen lives close by, in a separate building at the back of the yard, which means she can drop in whenever she wants. Which seems to be often, though I can never remember her actual visits. Just this vague sense that she's always around. Always watching.

She's elegant in a way that makes me feel inadequate. Silver hair styled perfectly, not a strand out of place. Tailored pants and a silk blouse. Pearl earrings. Her posture is straight, her expression pleasant but cool. The kind of woman who makes you conscious of every flaw.

"Hello, Helen," I say, trying to arrange the plates on the table in a way that looks intentional. "Are you staying for dinner?"

"If I'm welcome." She glides into the room—that's the only word for how she moves, glides, like she's floating an inch above the floor—and picks up one of the forks I just placed. She examines it, turning it over in her hand, checking for... what? Spots? Tarnish? Then she sets it back down, half an inch to the left of where I'd placed it. A correction so subtle I almost miss it.

"You look tired, dear," she says.

"I'm fine."

"David says you've been having more episodes."

Episodes. That word again. The word everyone uses to describe my... what? My blank spots? My confusion? The moments when I lose time or can't remember where I am or stand staring at walls without realizing it?

"I'm having a good day," I lie.

"Are you?" Helen sets down another fork, adjusting its position slightly. Another correction to my place settings. "That's good to hear. David worries so much about you. We all do."

The way she says "we all" makes my skin prickle. Like there are meetings being held about me. Discussions. Plans being made. We all worry about Emma. We all think she's getting worse. We all agree something needs to be done.

"I appreciate the concern," I say, finishing with the plates. "Really."

"It must be so frightening." Helen moves closer and I smell her perfume. Something floral and expensive. Roses maybe, or jasmine. "To lose yourself bit by bit. Your poor mother went through the same thing, didn't she? I remember David telling me about her. How sad. How very, very sad."

There's something in her tone that I can't identify. Sympathy? Pity? Or something else? Something that sounds almost like satisfaction.

"My mother was forty-two when she started showing symptoms," I say, defensive. "I'm only thirty-eight."

"But these things run in families, don't they?" Helen touches one of the water glasses, adjusts its position slightly. "Genetic predispositions. David must have known when he married you that this might happen eventually. How brave of him to take that risk."

Brave of him. The words land like little punches. As if loving me required courage. As if I'm a burden he chose to carry. As if my illness—if that's what this is—is something he knew about from the beginning and married me anyway, like he deserves credit for that.

"I should check on dinner," I say, needing to get away from her perfume and her adjustments and her carefully worded implications.

But Helen's hand shoots out and catches my wrist. Her grip is surprisingly strong. Her fingers wrap around my arm and hold me in place.

"I just want you to know," she says, her voice dropping to something almost confidential, "that I support whatever decisions David needs to make. For your own good, of course. Sometimes the kindest thing is to acknowledge when you can no longer care for yourself."

I pull my wrist free. "I can take care of myself."

"Of course you can, dear." She releases me, then pats my arm gently. Like I'm a child who's said something charmingly naive. "Of course you can."

I go back to the kitchen. Claire is working efficiently at the stove, seasoning the chicken with herbs and butter, preparing vegetables, moving with the kind of competence I used to have. The kind of competence that's been taken from me piece by piece.

By six o'clock, dinner is ready. Claire has done everything. Made the chicken, roasted the vegetables, even set out wine glasses and filled them with something red that I don't remember opening. The kitchen smells amazing—rosemary and garlic and butter—and I've contributed nothing except setting the table incorrectly.

David arrives exactly at six. I hear his car in the driveway, the sound of his keys in the front door, his footsteps in the hallway. He comes into the dining room already smiling, already playing the role of devoted husband coming home to his wife.

"This looks wonderful," he says, kissing my forehead before taking his seat at the head of the table. The head of the table in this house is apparently his spot, a position that gives him a view of everyone else. "You're feeling better today?"

I nod because it's easier than explaining. Easier than saying that I couldn't remember how to cook a chicken, that his mother made me feel like an incompetent child, that the house feels wrong and I can't figure out why.

"Emma was just telling me how well she's doing," Helen offers from across the table. She's already seated, wine glass in hand, looking perfectly at home. "Such a good day."

Except I'm not doing well. I'm fragmenting. Coming apart at the seams. The house feels wrong, my mother-in-law feels hostile, Claire is watching everything with those analytical eyes, and David is sitting there smiling at me like everything is perfectly normal.

"I'm glad," David says. He picks up his fork and starts eating. "You know I only want you to be happy, darling."

Do I know that? I study his face, trying to find evidence of his claim. He's handsome—I remember thinking he was handsome when we met, though I can't quite access the specific memory—with dark hair going silver at the temples and blue eyes that crinkle at the corners when he smiles. He looks like a man who's concerned about his sick wife. Who's doing his best in a difficult situation.

But all I see is a stranger who knows things about me that I don't know myself. Who discusses me with other people. Who controls which pills I take and when I take them and what I'm told about my own medical condition.

"Tell me about how we met," I hear myself say.

David pauses, fork halfway to his mouth. "What?"

"How we met. I want to hear the story." I lean forward, ignoring Helen's raised eyebrow and Claire's sudden stillness at the other end of the table. "Tell me how we met."

"Emma, we've talked about this before." David sets down his fork carefully. "The doctors said it's normal for you to forget certain—"

"Please. Just tell me."

He sighs. Not an angry sigh. Just patient. Indulgent. The way you'd sigh at a child who's asking the same question for the hundredth time.

"We met at a gallery opening," he says. "You were the director of Lumina Gallery on Fifth Street downtown. I was there looking at pieces for a client's new building. You were wearing a blue dress and you were arguing with an artist about the placement of his sculpture. I thought you were beautiful and fierce and I knew I had to talk to you."

The story sounds right. I can almost picture it. The white walls of a gallery, the carefully positioned spotlights, the clusters of people holding wine glasses and discussing art. Me in a blue dress. Some artist upset about positioning or lighting or something pretentious.

But there's another memory trying to surface. Pushing its way through the fog. A different story.

"I thought it was a red dress," I say slowly. "And we met at a coffee shop. You spilled coffee on my laptop and we spent twenty minutes trying to clean it off. You were embarrassed and I was annoyed but then we started laughing and you offered to buy me dinner to make up for it."

David's expression doesn't change. "No, sweetheart. It was a blue dress. At a gallery opening. You argued with the artist—his name was Marcus, I think—about where his sculpture should be positioned. Then I asked you to dinner."

"But I remember—" I stop, because the memory of the coffee shop is so clear. I can see him spilling his cup as he turned around, can see the brown liquid spreading across my keyboard, can hear myself laughing even though I was frustrated. It feels real. It feels like something that actually happened.

"You remember wrong," David says gently. "The doctors explained this. Confabulation. Your brain is trying to fill in gaps with false memories. What I'm telling you is what actually happened. I was there. I remember it correctly."

I look at Helen. She's nodding, her expression sympathetic. I look at Claire. Her face reveals nothing, but her eyes are moving between me and David like she's cataloging this entire exchange.

"Maybe you're right," I whisper, though everything in me says otherwise. The coffee shop memory feels so real. More real than the gallery story. But if David says it happened differently, if I have this condition that makes me remember things that never occurred, then maybe I really am making it up.

Maybe I really am going crazy.

"Eat your dinner, darling," David says, squeezing my hand across the table. "Claire did such a beautiful job with this chicken."

Claire. Not me. Claire made dinner. Claire set the table properly. Claire does everything I used to be able to do.

The rest of dinner passes in a haze. Helen talks about her book club—some thriller where the wife murders the husband, or maybe it's the other way around. David mentions a project at work, something about a museum renovation, but I can't follow the details. Claire sits quietly, eating methodically, her eyes constantly moving between the three of us like she's taking notes on everything being said.

When Helen finally stands to leave, kissing David's cheek and giving me a pitying smile, I feel something loosen in my chest. One less person watching me. One less witness to my deterioration.

"I'll clean up," Claire says, already stacking plates.

"Thank you," David says. He stands, stretches. "I have some work to finish in my office. Emma, why don't you watch some television? Try to relax."

Relax. Another code word for: go sit quietly somewhere while the adults handle things.

I nod because I'm too tired to argue.

In the living room, I turn on the TV without really looking at what's playing. Some cooking competition. People making elaborate desserts under time pressure, stressed about whether their cakes will rise or their frosting will set. I watch without processing any of it. My mind is stuck on the two different stories of how David and I met. Blue dress or red dress. Gallery or coffee shop. Which one is real and which one did my damaged brain invent?

At some point I must fall asleep, because when I open my eyes the TV is on a different channel—the news now, something about local politics—and the light through the windows has changed. It's darker outside. Later. How much later? An hour? Three hours?

I push myself off the couch, my muscles stiff, and wander through the house trying to reorient myself. The kitchen is clean, all the dishes put away. Claire's coat is still hanging by the back door, which means she hasn't left yet. David's office door is closed, a strip of light visible underneath.

I climb the stairs slowly, one hand on the railing for balance. My reflection catches in the hallway mirror and I stop, startled by the woman looking back at me. She looks older than thirty-eight. Tired. Scared. Lost.

In the bathroom, I splash cold water on my face, trying to wake myself up. That's when I notice the tile work behind the sink.

The grout is darker in one section. Recently repaired.

I lean closer, examining it. Several lines of grout between the tiles have been dug out and replaced. The work is neat, professional, but it's definitely been redone recently. The new grout is lighter colored than the old stuff, not quite matched.

My fingers trace the new grout lines. Something clicks in my memory—fuzzy, indistinct, but there.

I was looking for something. Notes. I'd been hiding notes to myself. Notes that kept disappearing. And I'd found a hiding place. Somewhere David wouldn't look. Somewhere secure.

The grout.

I'd carved it out. Hollowed the space behind the tiles. Created a hiding place for my notes. Hadn't I?

I press on one of the tiles gently, testing it. Then harder. It shifts slightly under the pressure. I work my fingernails into the edges, wiggling it carefully. The tile pops free, revealing a small hollow space behind it.

Empty.

My heart starts hammering. There was something here. I'm certain of it. Something important. Something I needed to hide from David. But now the space is empty and the grout has been replaced and any evidence of what I hid has been removed.

Or am I imagining this too? Is this another false memory, another confabulation? Did I never hide anything here? Did I dream the whole thing?

I replace the tile carefully, pressing it back into place. Wash my hands. Avoid looking at my reflection because I can't stand to see the fear in my own eyes.

Back in the bedroom, I sit on the edge of the mattress and try to make sense of the day. The kitchen that feels wrong. Helen's barely concealed hostility. The conflicting stories about how David and I met. The hidden space behind the bathroom tiles that's now empty.

Everything feels arranged. Staged. Like I'm living in a set designed to look like my life but decorated by people who don't quite understand who I am. Who I used to be.

My phone buzzes on the nightstand. A text from Kate.

*Please call me. I'm worried about you.*

I should call her. Tell her about the notes, the tiles, the feeling that nothing in this house belongs to me anymore. Tell her about the two different stories of how I met David. Tell her I think something is very, very wrong.

But what would I say? That my husband is lying to me about how we met? That his mother wants me gone? That the caregiver he hired is watching me too carefully? That I found a hiding place behind bathroom tiles but can't remember what I hid there?

She'd tell David. Tell him I'm getting worse. Suggest the care facility again. The one in Chester that she mentioned on the phone. The one that's "supposed to be really nice" and "specializes in early-onset cases."

I delete the message without responding.

When David finally comes to bed—I check the clock, it's 11:47—I pretend to be asleep. He moves quietly through the room, changing into pajamas, brushing his teeth. Then he slides into bed beside me and kisses my forehead. The gesture used to feel loving. Now it feels like he's checking my temperature. Assessing my condition.

I lie there in the dark, listening to his breathing even out, trying to remember the man I married. Trying to access some feeling of love or trust or even familiarity. But there's nothing. Just blank space where those emotions should be.

I'm thirty-eight years old. I used to run an art gallery. I used to cook elaborate dinners. I used to know my own mind.

Now I can't even remember if I met my husband at a gallery or a coffee shop. Can't remember what our kitchen used to look like. Can't hold onto information for more than a few hours.

And the worst part is, I don't know if I'm losing my mind or if someone is taking it from me piece by piece.

I don't know if there's even a difference between the two.
