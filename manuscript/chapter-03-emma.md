# Chapter 3
## EMMA

David wants me to make dinner tonight.

"It would be good for you," he says that morning over coffee. "Something familiar. Something you used to do all the time."

I nod because it seems easier than arguing, but the truth is I can't remember the last time I cooked a full meal. Claire handles most of the cooking now. Before that—was there a before that? There must have been. I must have fed myself at some point.

"Nothing complicated," David continues. "Maybe that chicken thing you used to make? With the lemon and herbs?"

Chicken with lemon and herbs. The words are familiar but abstract, like vocabulary from a language I used to speak.

"Sure," I say. "I can do that."

He smiles and kisses my forehead. "I knew you could. I'll invite my mother. She'd love to see you doing so well."

Helen. His mother. The thought of her watching me attempt to cook makes my stomach turn, but I just nod again and drink my coffee and try to look like a person who knows how to roast a chicken.

After David leaves for work, Claire finds me in the kitchen staring at the refrigerator.

"Need help?" she asks.

"No. I'm making dinner tonight. Chicken with lemon and herbs."

"That sounds nice."

"Do we have chicken?"

She opens the refrigerator and pulls out a whole raw chicken, already in a roasting pan. "David must have gotten it this morning. He thinks of everything."

The chicken is pale and pimpled and cold-looking. I should know what to do with it. This should be automatic—wash it, season it, into the oven. Simple. But looking at it now, I can't remember the order of operations. Do you wash it first? Or season it first? How hot should the oven be?

"What time is dinner?" Claire asks.

"Six. I think. David said six."

"So you'll want to start around four-thirty. Maybe five." She's watching me with that careful expression again. "Do you remember the recipe?"

"Yes," I lie.

She nods slowly. "Okay. Well, I'll be around if you need anything."

She leaves me alone with the chicken.

I pull out my phone and search "chicken with lemon and herbs recipe." Hundreds of results. I click on one that looks simple. Four hundred degrees. Sixty to seventy-five minutes. Salt, pepper, lemon, rosemary, thyme, garlic. I can do this.

I find the spices in the cabinet. The rosemary is dried and looks like little brown needles. Is that right? Or should it be fresh? The recipe says fresh but we only have dried. Will that matter? I pour some into my palm and smell it. It smells like rosemary. That seems promising.

By four-thirty, I'm standing in the kitchen with the chicken in front of me and herbs and lemons and garlic spread out like surgery instruments. The oven is preheating. I can do this. I used to do this. This is not impossible.

I wash my hands. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Season it with salt and pepper. Cut the lemon into quarters and stuff them inside the cavity. Rub herbs on the skin. Drizzle with olive oil. Into the oven.

It takes me forty minutes to do what should take ten, but I do it. By the time the chicken is in the oven, I'm sweating and my hands smell like raw poultry and garlic, but I feel something like pride.

I can still do this. I'm not completely useless.

Helen arrives at five-thirty in a cloud of expensive perfume and disapproval. She's seventy-two but looks sixty, the kind of woman who has a dermatologist and a personal trainer and opinions about everything.

"Emma, darling," she says, offering her cheek for me to kiss. "You look tired."

"I'm fine. I've been cooking."

"How ambitious." She sweeps into the living room and sits on the white sofa like it's a throne. "Where's David?"

"Still at work. He should be home soon."

"And the girl? The helper?"

"Claire. She's upstairs."

Helen sniffs. "I still don't understand why you need a full-time aide. You're not that far gone."

I don't know how to respond to that, so I excuse myself to check on the chicken.

In the kitchen, Mrs. Vasquez is wiping down the counters. She's been the housekeeper for twenty years, David says. She was here when he married Rebecca. She's here now with me. She knows this house better than I do.

"Smells good," she says without looking up.

"Thanks. I'm making chicken."

"I know. Mr. Tate told me this morning." She glances at me, something soft in her expression. "You need help?"

"No. I think I'm okay."

She nods and goes back to wiping, but I catch her looking at me once more before she moves to the dining room.

David comes home at six exactly, bringing wine and a smile. "How's my chef?" he asks, pulling me into a hug.

"The chicken is almost done."

"Perfect. Let me just say hello to Mother."

They talk in low voices in the living room while I set the table. Or I try to set the table. The silverware drawer is a jumble and I can't remember which fork goes where. Salad fork on the outside? Or inside? Big spoon or little spoon? Why are there so many spoons?

Claire appears beside me. "Need help?"

"I can set a table," I snap.

She raises her hands in surrender. "Okay. Just offering."

I put forks and knives and spoons at each place and hope it's right. Add plates and napkins and wine glasses. It looks fine. It looks like a table.

The chicken comes out of the oven at six-twenty, golden and crispy-skinned and actually beautiful. I feel a surge of something close to joy. I did this. I made something work.

David carves while I bring out the sides—roasted vegetables that Mrs. Vasquez must have prepared, because I definitely didn't make them, and a salad, and bread. We all sit down—David at the head, Helen to his right, me to his left, Claire at the far end like she's not quite part of the family.

"This looks wonderful, Emma," David says, serving chicken onto my plate.

"Yes, very nice," Helen adds, though her tone suggests otherwise.

I cut into the chicken and take a bite. It's good. It's actually good. Moist and flavorful and I made it.

"So Emma," Helen says, delicately cutting her own piece. "David tells me you're still seeing Dr. Chen."

"Yes."

"And how is that going?"

"Fine."

"Any improvement?"

"The progression is consistent."

"What does that mean?"

David intervenes smoothly. "It means we're managing the symptoms. Emma's doing very well."

Helen makes a small noise that might be agreement or doubt. "Well, I hope so. This must be very difficult for you, David. Dealing with all of this."

"Mother—"

"I'm just saying. You're so young to be in this position. Both of you." She looks at me with something like pity. "It's a terrible thing, losing your mind."

The bite of chicken in my mouth suddenly tastes like ash. I force myself to swallow.

"I haven't lost my mind," I say quietly.

"Of course not. I didn't mean—I just meant it's a difficult situation."

"I'm right here. I can hear you."

"Emma." David's voice carries a warning. "Mother didn't mean anything by it."

"Didn't she?"

Helen sets down her fork with a delicate clink. "I can see you're upset. I apologize if I said something wrong."

But she doesn't sound sorry. She sounds like someone performing an apology for an audience.

We eat in tense silence for a few minutes. I focus on my plate, on chewing and swallowing, on not letting them see how much I want to leave this table.

"You know," David says eventually, his voice deliberately light, "I was just thinking about how we met. Emma and I."

I look up. Helen smiles encouragingly. Claire watches with apparent interest.

"It was at a gallery opening," David continues. "Not Emma's gallery—someone else's. She was there scouting for artists. I was there because a client had some pieces in the show. She was wearing this blue dress—"

"Green," I say.

David pauses. "What?"

"It was a green dress. Dark green."

He laughs gently. "No, love. I'm sure it was blue. I remember because it matched your eyes."

My eyes are hazel. And the dress was green. I can see it clearly—emerald green, sleeveless, a dress I loved and wore until the zipper broke.

"It was green," I say again.

"Emma—"

"And it wasn't at someone else's gallery. It was at mine. My opening for Marcus Webb. The metal sculptor."

David's smile doesn't waver but something shifts in his eyes. "I think you might be mixing up different memories, sweetheart. It was definitely at the Hartley Gallery. I remember because I almost didn't go that night."

The Hartley Gallery. I know that name. But that's not where we met. I know it's not.

Except—do I know? Or do I just think I know?

"Maybe you're right," I hear myself say.

"I am right." He reaches over and squeezes my hand. "But it's sweet that you remember the dress, even if you got the color wrong."

Helen laughs softly. "Memory is such a funny thing, isn't it?"

Claire says nothing, but when I glance at her, she's looking at me with an expression I can't read.

The rest of the dinner passes in a blur of small talk and wine and Helen's cutting observations disguised as concern. I eat without tasting. I respond without thinking. I'm there but not there, present but absent.

When it's finally over and Helen leaves with air kisses and false sympathy, David helps me clear the table.

"You did wonderfully tonight," he says. "I'm proud of you."

"The dress was green."

He stops loading the dishwasher and looks at me. "Emma—"

"I remember it was green. I wore it to my own opening. Marcus was showing those pieces made from car parts. There was a sculpture of a heron that you loved. You said it reminded you of your grandmother's lake house."

David is quiet for a long moment. Then he closes the dishwasher and turns to face me fully. "You're confabulating again. Dr. Chen warned us about this. You're taking pieces of different memories and combining them into something that feels real but isn't."

"I'm not—"

"The dress was blue. The gallery was Hartley's. And I never had a grandmother with a lake house." His voice is patient, kind, devastatingly certain. "I know you believe what you're saying. But that doesn't make it true."

I open my mouth to argue but no words come. Because what if he's right? What if my brain is creating false memories, stitching together fragments into coherent lies?

What if I can't trust anything I remember?

"Come on," David says gently. "Let's get you to bed. It's been a long day."

I let him lead me upstairs. Let him help me change into pajamas like I'm a child. Let him tuck me in and kiss my forehead and turn off the light.

In the darkness, I lie very still and listen to him move around the bedroom, getting ready for bed himself. The familiar sounds of his routine—closet opening, clothes rustling, bathroom water running.

The dress was green. I know it was green.

But I also know I can't trust my own mind anymore.

And maybe that's exactly what someone would want. For me to doubt everything. For me to question every memory until I have nothing solid to stand on.

The note said don't trust him.

But what if I can't even trust myself?

David settles into bed beside me, his breathing gradually evening out into sleep.

I stay awake, staring at the ceiling, trying to hold onto the memory of a green dress.

And wondering when I started losing the ability to tell the difference between remembering and inventing.
