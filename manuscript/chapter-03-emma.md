# Chapter 3
## EMMA

I stand in the kitchen holding a knife and can't remember what to do with it.

Dinner. I'm making dinner. I know this because David mentioned it this morning—or was it yesterday?—and because there's a whole chicken sitting on the cutting board in front of me, pink and raw and somehow accusatory.

I used to know how to do this. Didn't I?

The kitchen feels wrong. The counters are too high or too low, I can't decide which. The island wasn't always white marble, was it? I remember dark granite. Or maybe butcher block. The stove has six burners when I'm certain it used to have four.

Or am I mixing this kitchen up with another kitchen, another house, another life?

"Would you like help?" Claire appears at my elbow, making me flinch. The knife clatters against the cutting board.

"I can do it," I say, but we both know it's a lie. I'm staring at this chicken like it's a complicated piece of machinery I've never seen before.

"It's already four-thirty. David will be home at six." Claire doesn't take the knife from me, doesn't touch the chicken, just stands there with that infuriating patience. "Maybe I should start dinner while you rest."

Rest. That's code for: *You can't do this anymore. You can't even make dinner.*

"I can cook my own dinner." The words come out harsh, defensive. "I've been cooking for twenty years. I don't need—"

But I stop because I can't remember what comes next. Season the chicken? Stuff it? Cut it into pieces? The steps that should be automatic, muscle memory built up over decades, have simply evaporated.

Claire waits exactly three seconds before gently taking the knife from my hand. "Why don't you set the table? The plates are in the cabinet to the left of the sink."

The cabinet to the left of the sink.

I open it and find only glasses.

"The other left," Claire says quietly.

My face burns as I open the correct cabinet. When did left and right become so complicated? When did I become someone who needs directions to find plates in my own kitchen?

Except—is this my kitchen? I trail my fingers along the counter as I carry dishes to the dining room, trying to summon some sense of familiarity, some spark of recognition. But the house feels like a museum I'm visiting, beautiful and cold and slightly hostile.

The dining room table is too large. I'm certain of that. It's dark wood, seats eight, dominates the space like it's trying to make a statement. But I remember—don't I?—a smaller table. Round. With a crack in the surface that David kept meaning to fix.

"Emma?" David's mother, Helen, stands in the doorway. When did she arrive? How long has she been in the house?

Helen is elegant in the way that terrifies me—perfectly coiffed silver hair, tailored clothing, a smile that never reaches her eyes. She lives in the guest house at the back of the property, which means she's always close enough to drop in unannounced.

Always watching.

"Hello, Helen." I arrange the plates mechanically, trying to look competent. "Are you staying for dinner?"

"If I'm welcome." She glides into the room, picking up a fork I just placed and examining it like she's checking for spots. "You look tired, dear."

"I'm fine."

"David says you've been having more episodes."

David says. David told her. David discusses me with his mother like I'm a problem that needs solving.

"I'm having a good day," I lie.

"Are you?" Helen sets down the fork—half an inch to the left of where I placed it, a correction so subtle I almost miss it. "That's good. David worries so much about you. We all do."

The way she says *we all* makes it sound like a conspiracy. Like there are meetings being held about me, discussions I'm not invited to, decisions being made without my input.

"I appreciate the concern." I finish setting the table, four places because apparently Helen is staying. "Really."

"It must be so frightening." Helen moves closer, her perfume—something floral and expensive—filling the space between us. "To lose yourself bit by bit. Your poor mother went through the same thing, didn't she? I remember David telling me. How sad. How very, very sad."

There's something in her voice. Pity? Satisfaction? I can't parse the emotion behind the words.

"My mother was older when it started," I say, defensive. "I'm only thirty-eight."

"But it runs in families, doesn't it? These things tend to. David must have known when he married you that this might happen. How brave of him to take that risk."

The words land like gentle blows. *Brave of him.* As if loving me required courage. As if I'm a burden he chose to bear.

"I should check on dinner." I move toward the kitchen, but Helen's hand shoots out, catches my wrist. Her grip is surprisingly strong.

"I just want you to know," she says, her voice dropping to something almost confidential, "that I support whatever decisions David needs to make. For your own good, of course. Sometimes the kindest thing is to acknowledge when you're no longer capable of caring for yourself."

I pull my wrist free. "I'm capable."

"Of course you are, dear." She releases me, pats my arm like I'm a child who's said something charmingly naive. "Of course you are."

By the time David arrives home, I'm so wound up I can barely sit still. Dinner is ready—Claire made rosemary chicken with roasted vegetables, plated everything beautifully, poured wine into crystal glasses I don't remember owning. I'm simply an observer at my own table, watching a domestic scene I'm no longer equipped to direct.

"This looks wonderful," David says, kissing my forehead before taking his seat at the head of the table. "You're feeling better today?"

I nod, not trusting my voice.

"Emma was just telling me how well she's doing," Helen offers from across the table. "Such a good day."

Except I'm not doing well. I'm fragmenting. The house feels wrong, my mother-in-law feels hostile, Claire is watching me with those analytical eyes, and David—

David is smiling at me like everything's fine.

"I'm glad," he says. "You know I only want you to be happy."

Do I know that? I study his face—handsome, familiar, supposedly beloved—and try to find evidence of his claim. But all I see is a stranger who knows things about me I don't know myself. Who talks about me to other people. Who controls which pills I take and when I take them.

"Tell me about how we met," I hear myself say.

David pauses, fork halfway to his mouth. "What?"

"How we met. Tell me the story." I lean forward, ignoring Helen's raised eyebrow and Claire's sudden stillness. "I want to hear it."

"Emma, we've talked about this. The doctors said it's normal for you to—"

"Please. Just tell me."

He sets down his fork with a soft clink. "We met at a gallery opening. You were the director. I was there looking at pieces for a client's new building. You were wearing a blue dress and arguing with an artist about the placement of his sculpture."

That sounds right. I can almost picture it—a blue dress, the sterile white space of a gallery, some pretentious artist upset about lighting or positioning or who knows what.

But then something shifts in my memory.

"I thought it was a red dress," I say slowly. "And we met at... a coffee shop? You spilled coffee on my laptop."

David's expression doesn't change. "No, sweetheart. Blue dress. Gallery opening. You argued with the artist—his name was Marcus—and I was so impressed by how you held your ground that I asked you to dinner."

"But I remember—"

"You remember wrong." His voice is gentle but firm. "The doctors explained this. Confabulation. Your brain is trying to fill in gaps with false memories. What I'm telling you is what actually happened."

I look to Helen, to Claire, hoping for... what? Confirmation? Contradiction? But Helen is nodding sympathetically and Claire's face reveals nothing.

"Maybe you're right," I whisper, though everything in me says otherwise. I remember a coffee shop. I remember laughing as he frantically tried to wipe coffee off my keyboard. I remember thinking he was charming and clumsy and sweet.

Don't I?

Or is that someone else's story that I've stolen and claimed as my own?

"Eat your dinner, darling." David squeezes my hand across the table. "Claire did such a beautiful job with this chicken."

The rest of dinner passes in a blur of small talk I can't quite follow. Helen discusses her book club. David mentions a project at work. Claire remains silent, eating methodically, her eyes moving between each of us like she's taking notes.

When Helen finally leaves, kissing David's cheek and offering me a pitying smile, I feel something loosen in my chest. One less witness. One less person cataloging my failures.

"I'll clean up," Claire says, already gathering plates.

"Thank you." David stands, stretches. "I have some work to finish in my office. Emma, why don't you watch some television? Relax."

Relax. Another code word. Another gentle suggestion that I remove myself from adult activities and go somewhere to be quietly confused.

I nod anyway, too tired to argue.

In the living room, I turn on the TV without processing what's playing. My mind is still stuck on the story of how we met. Blue dress or red dress. Gallery or coffee shop. Which is the truth and which is the manufactured memory?

At some point I must doze off, because when I open my eyes the TV is on a different channel and the light through the windows has changed. How long was I asleep? Minutes? Hours?

I push off the couch, muscles stiff, and wander through the house trying to reorient myself. The kitchen is clean, dishes put away. There's no sign of Claire, though her coat is still hanging by the door. David's office door is closed, a line of light visible underneath.

I climb the stairs, one hand trailing along the wall for balance. My reflection catches in the hallway mirror and I stop, startled. The woman looking back seems older than thirty-eight. Tired. Lost.

Scared.

In the bathroom, I splash cold water on my face, trying to shock myself awake. That's when I notice the tile behind the sink.

The grout is darker in one section. Recently repaired.

I lean closer, examining it. Someone has dug out and replaced several lines of grout between tiles. The work is neat but noticeable if you're looking for it.

My fingers trace the new grout lines, and something clicks in my fractured memory.

I was looking for something. A note. Notes I'd written to myself. I was hiding them in...

The grout.

I'd carved out the grout, hollowed the space behind tiles, created a hiding place.

Hadn't I?

I press on the tiles, gently at first, then harder. One shifts slightly under pressure. I wiggle it, work my fingernails into the edges, and it pops free, revealing a small hollow space behind it.

Empty.

My heart hammers. There was something here. I'm certain of it. Something I hid. Something David found and removed and covered up.

Or am I making that up too? Is this another false memory, another confabulation?

I replace the tile carefully, wash my hands, avoid looking at my reflection.

Back in the bedroom, I sit on the edge of the mattress and try to make sense of the day. The wrong kitchen. Helen's veiled hostility. The story of our meeting that doesn't match my memory. The hidden space behind the bathroom tiles.

Everything feels like it's been carefully arranged by someone else. Like I'm living in a set designed to look like my life but decorated by people who don't quite understand who I used to be.

My phone buzzes. A text from Kate.

*Please call me. I'm worried about you.*

I should call her. Tell her about the notes, the tiles, the feeling that nothing in this house belongs to me anymore.

But what would I say? That I think my husband is lying to me about how we met? That I think his mother wants me gone? That I think the caregiver he hired is documenting my decline with a little too much interest?

She'd tell David. She'd say I'm getting worse. She'd suggest the care facility again.

I delete the message without responding.

When David finally comes to bed, I pretend to be asleep. He kisses my forehead—a gesture that used to feel loving but now feels like he's checking my temperature—and settles beside me.

I lie there in the dark, listening to his breathing even out, trying to remember the man I married.

Trying to remember if I'm the one losing myself, or if someone is taking me apart piece by piece.

And wondering if there's any difference between the two.
