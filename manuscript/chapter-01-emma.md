# Chapter 1
## EMMA

The note is in my handwriting.

I know this because of the way the 'T' loops at the top, the way my mother taught me when I was seven. The way I've written my name on a thousand gallery contracts. The familiar slant of letters marching across the torn edge of paper.

But I don't remember writing it.

Three words in black ink: DON'T TRUST HIM.

My hand trembles as I hold it—this message from myself to myself, like a letter from a stranger who knows my secrets. I found it tucked inside the bathroom medicine cabinet, wedged behind the orange prescription bottles that line the shelf like soldiers. My pills. David says they help with the confusion, but sometimes I wonder if they make it worse.

I don't remember writing this note. I don't remember hiding it there. I don't remember anything about it at all.

"Emma?" David's voice drifts up the stairs, warm and concerned. "Darling, are you okay up there?"

My fingers crush the paper. Who is *him*? Don't trust who?

Don't trust David?

No. That's crazy. David is my husband. David loves me. David takes care of me now that I can't seem to take care of myself.

"I'm fine," I call back, but my voice cracks on the last word. I smooth the note flat against the marble countertop, studying the handwriting again. It's definitely mine. The same pen I use for everything—black gel, fine point. There's even a small ink smudge on the 'O' where my left hand probably dragged across the wet letters.

I wrote this. When? Yesterday? Last week? A month ago?

The worst part isn't that I don't remember writing it. The worst part is that I might have had a good reason.

I fold the note into a small square, my heart hammering against my ribs. I need to hide it. Need to keep it safe. But where? Somewhere David won't look. Somewhere I can find it again.

*But you didn't find it,* whispers a voice in my head. *It was there the whole time and you forgot.*

I shake off the thought and slip the folded paper between two books on the shelf above the toilet—a hardcover novel and a collection of poetry I haven't touched in months. Or have I? I can't remember the last time I read anything. The words swim on the page lately, refusing to stay still long enough for me to catch their meaning.

"Emma? Your medication, sweetheart."

David appears in the bathroom doorway, a glass of water in one hand and two pills in the other. His dark hair is silver at the temples now—or was it always that way? He's handsome in the way that architects often are, all clean lines and careful proportions. When did we meet? How long have we been married?

I should know this.

"You looked so far away just then," he says, setting the water glass on the counter with a soft clink. His eyes—brown, kind, worried—search my face. "Are you having another episode?"

Episode. That's what he calls it when I lose time. When I can't remember where I put things or why I'm standing in a room or what day of the week it is.

"No," I lie. "Just tired."

He holds out his palm, the pills resting in the center like tiny promises. One white, one blue. I take them, put them in my mouth, sip the water. The white one tastes bitter even through the water, coating my tongue with something chemical and wrong.

David watches until I swallow.

"Good girl," he says, and there's something in his tone that makes my skin prickle. Satisfaction? Relief?

Or am I imagining that too?

"You scared me earlier," he continues, leaning against the doorframe. "You were standing in the kitchen, just staring at the wall. For almost ten minutes. I called your name three times before you heard me."

Was I? I don't remember. The morning is already slipping away from me, hours dissolving like sugar in water. Did I eat breakfast? Did I shower? I'm wearing jeans and a sweater, so I must have gotten dressed, but I can't recall pulling on these clothes.

"I'm sorry," I whisper, because that's what I always say now. I'm sorry for forgetting. I'm sorry for being difficult. I'm sorry for turning into this person who can't remember if she wrote a warning to herself in her own bathroom.

"Don't apologize." David crosses to me, cups my face in both hands. His palms are warm, familiar. "It's not your fault. The doctors said this would happen. Your mother—"

"I know." I pull away before he can finish. I don't want to hear about my mother. Don't want to think about the way she looked at me in those final years, her eyes empty of recognition, asking the nurse who I was. Asking if I was her sister. Her friend. A stranger who'd wandered into her room.

Three years she forgot me before she died.

Is that what's happening to me? Is this genetic? Did my mother also write notes to herself, warnings she couldn't remember, evidence of a truth she was trying desperately to hold onto?

"You need to rest," David says. "Why don't you lie down for a bit? I'll bring you some lunch later."

I nod, but I don't move toward the bedroom. I'm looking at the shelf above the toilet, at the two books pressed together. The note is there. I put it there. Just minutes ago.

Didn't I?

"Emma?"

"I'll rest," I say, and the words feel automatic, pre-recorded. "I'm just going to wash my face first."

He studies me for a moment longer, then kisses my forehead. "I'll be in my office if you need me."

When he's gone, I count to sixty in my head. Then I reach for the books.

My hands close on the hardcover spine. I pull it from the shelf, and the poetry collection beside it. I check between them. Behind them. On the shelf underneath.

Nothing.

The note is gone.

I put it there. I know I did. I remember the weight of the folded paper, the feeling of sliding it into place. That was—what, five minutes ago? Less?

But it's not there now.

My breath comes faster. I check the other shelves, running my fingers along the spines of books I don't remember buying, magazines I don't recall reading. I check inside the novels, shake them upside down. I check the medicine cabinet again, moving all the orange bottles, looking behind the Band-Aids and the dental floss and the spare toothpaste.

Nothing.

Did I hide it somewhere else? Did I dream the whole thing?

Or did David take it while I was distracted?

*Don't trust him.*

I sink onto the edge of the bathtub, my pulse loud in my ears. What if the note is real? What if I wrote it during a moment of clarity, a warning from my functioning self to my forgetting self?

What if I'm not going crazy?

What if someone is making me crazy?

I press my palms against my eyes until I see stars. This is paranoia. This is exactly what the doctors warned David about. Confabulation, they called it. Creating false memories to fill in the gaps. My brain is trying to make sense of its own deterioration by inventing conspiracies, by turning my devoted husband into a villain.

Except.

Except I found a note. I know I did. I remember the paper, the ink, the handwriting.

My handwriting.

I stand, straighten my sweater, look at myself in the mirror. The woman looking back seems familiar but somehow wrong, like a painting that's been reproduced too many times, each copy a little less accurate than the last. My blonde hair needs washing. There are dark circles under my green eyes. I used to be pretty. I think. I used to run an art gallery. I think. I used to be someone who could trust herself.

I think.

Downstairs, I can hear David's voice, low and steady, talking on the phone in his office. I move to the top of the stairs, listening.

"...faster than we expected," he's saying. "We may need to accelerate the timeline."

Timeline for what?

My medical treatment? Facility placement? Something else?

I should go downstairs and ask him. Communication. That's what the marriage counselor said, back before I got too sick to remember our appointments. Open communication is key.

But something stops me.

Something about the way he watched me swallow those pills. Something about the satisfaction in his voice. Something about a note that disappeared after I hid it.

*Don't trust him.*

I believe myself. The version of me who wrote that note, whoever she was, whenever she was—I believe her.

I just wish I could remember why.

I turn back to the bathroom, determined to search again, to find the note, to prove to myself that I'm not losing my mind completely. But when I reach the doorway, I freeze.

Where did I put it?

I know I hid it. I remember hiding it. But the location has already slipped away, dissolving like everything else.

I search for the next twenty minutes, growing more frantic with each passing second. Books. Shelves. Cabinet. Drawers. Under the sink. Behind the mirror.

Nothing.

By the time David calls me down for lunch, I can't remember if the note was real or if I imagined it entirely.

I can't remember if I'm going insane or if someone wants me to think I am.

And that, I'm beginning to understand, might be the most terrifying question of all.
