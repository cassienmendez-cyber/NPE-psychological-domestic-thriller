# Chapter 1
## EMMA

The note is in my handwriting.

I'm standing in the bathroom, staring at a piece of torn notebook paper, and I recognize my own handwriting. The looping T at the top of each word. The way the letters slant slightly to the right. Even the small ink smudge on the O where my left hand dragged across the wet ink.

Three words in black gel pen: DON'T TRUST HIM.

I found it five minutes ago. Maybe ten. I'm not sure anymore. I was looking for aspirin in the medicine cabinet—at least I think that's why I came in here—and when I opened the cabinet door, the note fell out from between two orange prescription bottles.

My prescription bottles. The ones David says help with my memory problems.

I don't remember writing this note. I don't remember hiding it in the medicine cabinet. I have absolutely no memory of putting pen to paper and writing these three words. But it's definitely my handwriting. I've seen it on enough gallery contracts and exhibition labels to know my own writing when I see it.

"Emma?" David's voice comes from downstairs. "Darling, are you okay up there?"

My hand closes around the note, crumpling it slightly. I look at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I'm thirty-eight years old. Blonde hair that needs washing. Green eyes with dark circles underneath. I used to be the director of an art gallery. I used to be someone who had her life together.

Now I'm someone who finds mysterious notes in her own handwriting and can't remember writing them.

"I'm fine," I call back. My voice sounds steadier than I feel. "Just looking for something."

I smooth the note flat on the marble countertop. The paper is cheap, torn from a spiral notebook. I can see the ragged edge where it was ripped out. The black ink is consistent throughout. No hesitation in the letters. Whoever wrote this—me, apparently—wrote it quickly and with purpose.

DON'T TRUST HIM.

Him. Who is him? Don't trust who?

The obvious answer makes my stomach twist. David is the only him who's really in my life anymore. My husband. The man I've been married to for—how long? I should know this. I should know how many years I've been married. But when I try to access that information, my mind goes blank. Like trying to open a file that's been corrupted.

David is my husband. David loves me. David takes care of me now that I can't seem to take care of myself. He makes sure I take my medication. He schedules my doctor appointments. He hired Claire to help me during the day when he's at work. He's patient when I forget things. He doesn't get angry when I ask the same question three times in an hour.

Why would I write a note telling myself not to trust him?

I turn the note over. The back is blank. No date. No explanation. Just those three words on the front.

"Emma? Your medication, sweetheart."

I look up and David is standing in the bathroom doorway. I didn't hear him come up the stairs. Didn't hear his footsteps in the bedroom. He's just suddenly there, holding a glass of water in one hand and two pills in the other palm.

I should be used to this by now—people appearing in rooms without me noticing—but it still startles me every time. Makes me feel like I'm losing minutes or hours and don't even know it.

David is forty-two. Tall, dark hair going silver at the temples. He's an architect. I remember that much. He designs buildings. Important buildings. Buildings people care about. He's wearing dark jeans and a white button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His usual weekend attire.

Is it the weekend? I glance at the window but that doesn't tell me anything. It could be Saturday or Tuesday for all I know.

"You looked so far away just then," David says. He's watching me carefully. The way you watch someone who might fall over at any moment. "Are you having another episode?"

Episode. That's what he calls it when I lose time. When I can't remember what I was doing or why I'm in a room or what day of the week it is. When I stand staring at walls for ten minutes without realizing it. When I wake up in the middle of the night not knowing where I am.

The doctors say I'm having episodes. David says I'm having episodes. My sister Kate says I'm having episodes. So I guess that's what they are.

"No episode," I say. I realize I'm still holding the note. I fold it quickly, trying to make the movement look casual. "Just thinking."

David sets the water glass on the counter. The clink of glass on marble seems too loud in the small bathroom. He holds out his other hand, palm up, with the two pills resting in the center.

One white. One blue.

I take them. I've been taking these pills for months. Maybe longer. The white one is supposed to help with cognitive function. The blue one is supposed to help with anxiety. Or is it the other way around? I can't remember. I've asked David to explain it to me before, but the information doesn't stick.

I put both pills in my mouth and take a sip of water from the glass David hands me. The white one has a bitter taste even through the water. It coats my tongue with something chemical and wrong. I swallow and show David my empty mouth like a child proving she took her medicine.

"Good girl," he says.

There's something about his tone that makes the back of my neck prickle. Not mean. Not unkind. Just... satisfied. Like he's pleased about something.

Or maybe I'm imagining it. Maybe my brain is adding sinister undertones to perfectly normal words because I'm paranoid and unreliable.

I slide the folded note into the pocket of my jeans while David is putting the water glass back on the counter. He doesn't seem to notice. Or if he does notice, he doesn't say anything about it.

"You scared me earlier," David says. He leans against the bathroom doorframe. His body language is relaxed but his eyes are sharp. Watchful. "You were standing in the kitchen, just staring at the wall. For almost ten minutes. I called your name three times before you heard me."

Was I? I try to remember this morning. Or was it this morning? When did today start? Did I wake up in bed? Did I eat breakfast? The memories are there but they're fuzzy. Indistinct. Like looking at something through frosted glass.

"I'm sorry," I say. It's automatic now. Sorry for forgetting. Sorry for being difficult. Sorry for being the version of myself that needs constant supervision.

"Don't apologize." David steps closer and cups my face in both hands. His palms are warm against my cheeks. "It's not your fault. The doctors said this would happen. Your mother—"

"I know." I pull away before he can finish the sentence. I don't want to talk about my mother. Don't want to think about the way she looked at me in the memory care facility during those last three years. The way she asked the nurses who I was. The way she forgot she even had a daughter.

My mother had early-onset dementia. She started showing symptoms at forty-two. She died at fifty-eight. She forgot me three years before she died.

Is that what's happening to me? Am I turning into my mother?

The doctors have run tests. Lots of tests. MRIs and cognitive assessments and blood work. David says they're monitoring the situation. He says we're being proactive. He says there's no need to panic yet.

But I can feel it happening. I can feel myself slipping away bit by bit. Losing hours. Losing days. Losing the basic ability to remember if I wrote a note in my own handwriting.

"You need to rest," David says. "Why don't you lie down for a bit? I'll bring you some lunch later."

I nod. It's easier than arguing. Easier than trying to explain that resting doesn't help, that when I wake up I'm just more confused, more lost in the fog that seems to be swallowing my life whole.

"I'll rest," I say. "I'm just going to wash my face first."

David studies me for another moment. Then he leans in and kisses my forehead. His lips are dry and warm. The gesture should feel loving but instead it feels like he's checking my temperature. Assessing my condition.

"I'll be in my office if you need me," he says.

He leaves. I listen to his footsteps going down the hall. Down the stairs. The sound of his office door closing.

I count to sixty in my head. Slow and deliberate. One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Making sure he's really gone.

Then I pull the note out of my pocket and unfold it.

DON'T TRUST HIM.

I need to hide this. Need to keep it safe. But where? Somewhere David won't look. Somewhere I can find it again.

That's the problem though, isn't it? I wrote this note. I hid it in the medicine cabinet. And then I completely forgot about it. If the note hadn't fallen out when I opened the cabinet, I might never have found it at all.

How many other notes have I written? How many other warnings have I left for myself that I'll never find because I can't remember where I put them?

I look around the bathroom. There are books on a shelf above the toilet. A hardcover novel and a collection of poetry. I don't remember the last time I read either one. The words swim on the page lately, refusing to stay still.

I slip the folded note between the two books. Careful to push it all the way back so it's not visible from the front. Then I step back and try to memorize the location.

Books. Above toilet. Between hardcover and poetry.

I repeat it to myself three times. Books above toilet. Books above toilet. Books above toilet.

But even as I'm repeating it, I can feel the information starting to slip. By tomorrow—or maybe even by this afternoon—will I remember hiding a note? Will I remember there was a note at all?

I wash my face with cold water, trying to shock some clarity into my brain. The water is icy against my skin. It helps for a moment. Makes me feel awake. Alert.

When I dry my face with a towel, I look at myself in the mirror again. The woman looking back seems familiar but somehow wrong. Like a painting that's been copied too many times, each version slightly less accurate than the original.

I used to be pretty. I think. I used to run Lumina Gallery. Or was it Luminance Gallery? I can't remember the exact name. I used to curate exhibitions and negotiate with artists and write press releases. I used to be competent. Capable.

Now I can barely remember to wash my face.

I turn away from the mirror before the self-pity can take hold. That's another thing that's been happening more often. These moments where I look at my life and feel completely overwhelmed by how far I've fallen. How much I've lost.

I should go lie down like David suggested. I should rest. But something pulls me back to the shelf above the toilet. Some nagging feeling that I've forgotten something important.

I reach for the books. Pull out the hardcover. Then the poetry collection.

No note.

I check between them. Behind them. On the shelf underneath.

Nothing.

My heart starts beating faster. I put it there. I know I did. I remember the feeling of sliding the folded paper between the books. That was—what, two minutes ago? Three?

But it's gone.

I check the other books on the shelf. Flip through pages. Shake them upside down. Check the medicine cabinet again, moving all the orange bottles, looking behind the Band-Aids and spare toothpaste and dental floss.

Nothing.

Did I hide it somewhere else? Did I dream the whole thing? Or did David take it while I was washing my face?

I can hear his voice from downstairs. Low and steady. Talking on the phone in his office. I move to the top of the stairs, listening.

"...faster than we expected," he's saying. "We may need to accelerate the timeline."

Timeline for what? My medical treatment? Some kind of care facility? What is he talking about?

I should go downstairs and ask him. That's what a normal person would do. Walk down to his office and say, "Hey, I heard you on the phone. What timeline? What are you talking about?"

But something stops me. Some instinct I don't entirely trust anymore.

The note said don't trust him. And now the note is gone. Disappeared in the three minutes since I hid it.

Maybe I'm being paranoid. Maybe the medication is making me suspicious and delusional. Maybe I hid the note somewhere else and forgot. Maybe I never hid it at all.

Or maybe I did hide it, and David found it, and now he's on the phone talking about accelerating timelines because he knows I'm starting to question things.

I don't know which option is worse. Being crazy or being right.

I go back to the bathroom and search again. More thoroughly this time. I check every book. Every shelf. I look in the drawers under the sink. I check inside the toilet tank. I run my hands along the grout between the tiles, looking for loose sections where something might be hidden.

Twenty minutes pass. Maybe more. I lose track of time, which is becoming my normal state of being.

Finally, I have to accept it. The note is gone. Either I hid it somewhere else and can't remember, or someone took it, or it never existed in the first place.

My hands are shaking as I sit down on the edge of the bathtub. This is what my life has become. Searching for notes I may or may not have written. Suspecting my husband of taking things that might not exist. Losing entire chunks of time without even realizing it.

The doctors have a name for it. Confabulation. Creating false memories to fill in the gaps. My brain is trying to make sense of its own deterioration by inventing stories. By turning ordinary events into conspiracies.

But what if it's not confabulation? What if I really did write that note? What if I had a good reason to warn myself?

I stand up and look at myself in the mirror one more time. I need to remember this moment. Need to hold onto the memory of finding that note, even if I can't hold onto the note itself.

DON'T TRUST HIM.

I repeat it in my head like a mantra. Don't trust him. Don't trust him. Don't trust him.

But who is him? And why shouldn't I trust him? And how am I supposed to figure any of this out when I can't even trust my own mind?

"Emma?" David's voice again, calling from the bottom of the stairs. "Lunch is ready."

Lunch. Already? How long have I been up here? It felt like minutes but it must have been longer. Much longer.

I take a deep breath and try to compose myself. Try to look normal. Like a wife coming down to have lunch with her husband. Not like a woman who's been frantically searching her bathroom for evidence of her own sanity.

When I get downstairs, David has set the kitchen table with two plates. Sandwiches. Chips. Glasses of water. He's even put out napkins. Everything arranged neatly, carefully. The way you arrange things for someone who can't be trusted to do it themselves.

"Turkey and swiss," he says, pulling out a chair for me. "Your favorite."

Is it my favorite? I can't remember. But I sit down and take a bite and it tastes good, so maybe he's right. Maybe turkey and swiss really is my favorite.

We eat in silence for a few minutes. David scrolls through his phone while he eats. I watch him and try to remember the man I married. Try to access memories of our wedding, our first date, the moment I knew I loved him.

But those memories are fuzzy too. Indistinct. Like someone else's story that I've heard but not lived.

"Do you remember how we met?" I ask. The question comes out before I can stop it.

David looks up from his phone. "What?"

"How we met. Do you remember?"

He sets down his sandwich. "Of course I remember. We've talked about this before, Emma."

"I know. I just... I want to hear it again."

David sighs, but it's not an angry sigh. Just patient. The way you're patient with a child who asks the same question over and over.

"We met at a gallery opening," he says. "You were the director. Lumina Gallery on Fifth Street. I was there looking at pieces for a client's new building. You were wearing a blue dress and you were arguing with an artist about the placement of his sculpture. I thought you were beautiful and fierce and I knew I had to talk to you."

That sounds right. A gallery opening. A blue dress. An argument about art placement. I can almost see it in my head.

But there's something else too. Another memory trying to surface. Something about a coffee shop. About David spilling coffee on my laptop. About laughing together while he tried to wipe down my keyboard.

"Are you sure it wasn't at a coffee shop?" I ask.

David's expression doesn't change. "I'm sure. Gallery opening. Blue dress. You argued with an artist named Marcus about his sculpture. Then I asked you to dinner."

The certainty in his voice makes me doubt my own memory. Maybe the coffee shop thing was a dream. Or a scene from a movie I'm confusing with real life. That happens sometimes now. Dreams blending with memories. Fiction feeling more real than reality.

"Okay," I say quietly. "I just thought..."

"You thought wrong," David says. Not unkind. Just matter-of-fact. "That's okay. It happens. The doctors explained this. Your brain is trying to fill in gaps. It creates false memories sometimes. That's normal for your condition."

My condition. Another term for whatever is happening to my mind. Whatever is taking me apart piece by piece.

I finish my sandwich even though I'm not hungry anymore. David cleans up the plates, rinses them in the sink, loads them into the dishwasher. All efficient movements. All done without asking if I want to help. Because we both know I'd probably just put things in the wrong place or forget what I was doing halfway through.

"Why don't you watch some TV?" David suggests. "Relax for a bit. I have some work to finish."

I nod and go to the living room. Turn on the television. Some cooking show is on. People making elaborate desserts. I watch without really seeing. My mind is still stuck on the note.

Did I really find it? Or did I imagine it?

And if I did find it, where did it go?

And if I imagined it, what does that say about what's happening to me?

At some point I must fall asleep because when I open my eyes, the TV is on a different channel and the light through the windows has changed. Time has passed. Hours maybe. I don't know how many.

This is my life now. Waking up and not knowing how much time has passed. Not knowing if what I remember is real or invented. Not knowing if I can trust the people around me or if I can't even trust myself.

I push off the couch and wander through the house, trying to orient myself. Trying to figure out what day it is, what time it is, what I'm supposed to be doing.

In the hallway, I catch my reflection in a mirror and stop. The woman looking back seems older than thirty-eight. Tired. Scared.

Lost.

I'm losing myself. Not just losing my memory. Losing the person I used to be. The capable, confident woman who ran an art gallery and made decisions and knew her own mind.

That woman is disappearing. And I don't know how to stop it.

I don't even know if it can be stopped.

All I know is that somewhere in my fractured mind, there's a warning. A message from a version of me who was lucid enough to write it down.

DON'T TRUST HIM.

And even though I can't remember writing it, even though I might have imagined the whole thing, something tells me I should listen.

The question is: what do I do about it?
