# Chapter 1
## EMMA

The note is tucked inside my vitamin organizer, folded twice, the paper soft from handling.

I don't remember putting it there.

My handwriting, though. Definitely mine—the cramped way I make capital T's, the backward slant when I write quickly. Blue pen, the kind David keeps in the kitchen drawer. The paper is from the notepad by the phone.

DON'T TRUST HIM.

Three words. No signature, no date, no context. Just that.

I'm standing in the bathroom with my Thursday morning pills in one hand and this note in the other, trying to remember. The trying feels like reaching into fog. I was here yesterday. I took my pills. I must have seen this note yesterday. Did I read it then? Did I put it here? When?

The face in the mirror looks like mine but tired, older than thirty-eight should look. My hair needs washing. There's a coffee stain on my collar that I don't remember making.

Don't trust who?

I know the answer. Of course I know the answer. There's only one "him" in this house who matters.

But that's insane. That's the kind of thing a paranoid person thinks, and I'm not—I'm not that. Dr. Chen said paranoia can be a symptom. She said confabulation, false memories, misplaced suspicion. She said a lot of things I wrote down and then couldn't find the paper where I wrote them.

I read the note again. My handwriting doesn't lie. I wrote this. I meant it when I wrote it. I was trying to tell myself something important.

What did I know that I don't know now?

The pills in my hand are blue and white and small and round. I take them every morning. They're supposed to help. That's what David says. That's what Dr. Chen prescribed. Memory support. Cognitive function. Vitamins.

I look at the note. I look at the pills.

I put the pills back in the organizer and close it.

The note I fold again, smaller this time, until it's a tiny square. I need to hide it somewhere David won't find it, somewhere I'll remember to look. The bathroom has new tiles—we renovated last year, or David says we renovated last year, though I don't remember construction. The grout lines are thin and white. There's a loose tile behind the toilet that rocks slightly when you press it. I wedge the note behind it and press the tile flat.

There.

Safe.

I'll remember that. I'll look there tomorrow and remember why I hid it.

Downstairs, David is making breakfast. I can smell coffee and something sweet—French toast maybe. He's singing along to the radio, some pop song I should probably recognize. His voice is good. He sang in college. He told me that when we met, or later, or—I can't remember if he told me or if I always knew.

The stairs are carpeted in pale gray, thick enough that my footsteps don't make sound. I hold the railing anyway. Dr. Chen said to be careful on stairs. She said a fall could be dangerous with my balance issues.

I don't remember having balance issues before six months ago. But six months ago is fuzzy. A lot of things are fuzzy.

The kitchen is full of light. Floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides, glass and steel and marble. David designed this house. He's an architect. Award-winning. The kitchen was featured in a magazine. I remember that—I think I remember that. There was a photo shoot. I had to clean everything three times. Or did I? Maybe that was our old apartment. Maybe that was someone else's house.

David looks up when I come in and his whole face changes. Soft. Concerned. Loving.

"There she is," he says. "How'd you sleep?"

"Fine," I say automatically.

"Yeah?" He flips a piece of French toast. "No wandering last night?"

Wandering. He means sleepwalking. He says I do that now, though I never did before. He says he finds me in strange places—standing in the hallway, sitting in the dark living room, once in the driveway in my nightgown. I don't remember any of it.

"I don't think so," I say.

"Good." He plates the toast and brings it to me with syrup and butter and a smile. "That's progress. The new medication must be working."

New medication. There's always new medication. I lose track.

"Did I take my pills this morning?" I ask, even though I know I didn't.

"I don't know, love. Did you?" He's watching me carefully. Not obviously. He thinks I don't notice. "They're in the organizer. Thursday."

"Right. Thursday." I look at the French toast. I'm not hungry. I'm never hungry in the mornings anymore but David says I need to eat. "I'll take them after breakfast."

"Perfect." He kisses my forehead as he passes, heading to the coffee maker. "Claire should be here soon. She's taking you to your appointment at ten."

"Appointment?"

"Dr. Chen. Remember? We talked about this Monday."

I don't remember Monday. Or I remember a Monday, but I don't know if it's the most recent one.

"Right," I say. "Of course."

David pours coffee—one cup for me, one for him. He knows how I take it. Cream, no sugar. Or he tells me that's how I take it, and it tastes right, so it must be true.

"Emma." His voice is gentle. "Did you take your pills?"

"Yes," I lie.

"You're sure?"

"Yes."

He studies me for a moment, then nods. "Okay. Good."

I cut into the French toast and eat a bite and it tastes like nothing. The coffee is better. I hold the mug with both hands and feel the warmth and that's real, that's something.

Claire arrives at nine-thirty. I hear her car in the driveway, then her key in the door—she has a key now, since when?—and then her voice calling out a greeting.

"Good morning," she says, appearing in the kitchen doorway. She's younger than me, late twenties maybe, with dark hair pulled back in a neat ponytail and a canvas bag over her shoulder. She looks at me with this expression I can't read. Sympathy? Assessment? Something else?

"Morning, Claire," David says. "She's all set for Dr. Chen. Just needs to grab her purse."

"I'll help her find it," Claire says, like I'm a lost item myself.

"It's in the bedroom," I say. "I know where it is."

"Great," Claire says with a smile that doesn't reach her eyes. "I'll come with you."

We go upstairs together, Claire slightly behind me like she's spotting me in case I fall. I don't need help. I want to tell her that, but I'm not sure it's true. Last week I fell in the shower. Or David says I fell. I don't remember falling, but there was a bruise.

My purse is on the chair by the window. I knew where it was.

"Emma," Claire says quietly. "How are you feeling today?"

"Fine."

"Yeah? You seem a little... off."

Off. That's a word people use a lot now. Off. Confused. Tired. Forgetful.

"I'm fine," I say again.

She nods, but she's looking at me the way David looks at me, the way Dr. Chen looks at me. Like I'm an unreliable narrator of my own life.

"Okay," she says. "Let's go then."

In the car, I watch the trees pass and try to remember the last time I drove. I used to drive. I had a car. A Volvo. Or was it an Audi? I can see it in my mind but I can't remember when I last sat in the driver's seat.

"Claire," I say. "What happened to my car?"

She glances at me. "Your car?"

"The one I drove. Before."

"Before?"

"Before I got sick."

She's quiet for a moment. "I think David said you sold it. When you stopped driving."

"When did I stop driving?"

"I'm not sure. Before I started."

"When did you start?"

"Six months ago, Emma. We've talked about this."

Six months. Everything changed six months ago. That's when Claire came. That's when the medications started. That's when I stopped working.

I used to run an art gallery. Contemporary art. I was good at it. People knew my name. I had artists who would only work with me. I had openings with wine and crowds and conversations about light and composition and meaning.

Now I have pills and appointments and a woman named Claire who watches me like I might disappear.

"Do you remember the gallery?" I ask.

"You've mentioned it."

"Did you ever visit? Before?"

"No."

"Why not?"

"I didn't know you then."

That should be obvious. But nothing feels obvious anymore.

Dr. Chen's office is in a medical building downtown, all glass and chrome and expensive art on the walls. Not the kind of art I used to sell. The kind that corporations buy to fill space.

The appointment is routine. Dr. Chen asks me questions—what day is it, who is the president, can I remember three words she tells me. I fail some of them. I know I'm failing. She writes things down. Claire sits in the corner, also writing things down, and I want to ask what she's writing but I'm afraid of the answer.

"The progression is consistent with what we've been seeing," Dr. Chen says to David, who appeared halfway through the appointment. When did he get here? How did I miss him arriving?

"Is there anything else we can try?" David asks. He sounds tired. He sounds like a man losing his wife piece by piece.

Maybe he is.

Maybe I'm being unfair, writing notes to myself that say don't trust him. Maybe he's doing everything he can and I'm the problem, my broken brain, my faulty memory, my increasing inability to hold onto anything solid.

"We can adjust the medication," Dr. Chen says. "Increase the dosage. See if that helps."

More medication. Different medication. It's always the solution.

"I'm right here," I say. "You can talk to me."

They both look at me with identical expressions of patient concern.

"Of course, Emma," Dr. Chen says. "I'm sorry. How are you feeling about the current treatment plan?"

The current treatment plan. Like I know what that is.

"I'm fine," I say.

On the drive home, David follows us in his car. I watch him in the side mirror. Claire is quiet, hands on the wheel, eyes on the road.

"Claire," I say. "Do you think I'm getting worse?"

"I think you're having a hard time," she says carefully.

"That's not what I asked."

She's quiet for a long moment. Then: "Yes. I think you're getting worse."

At least she's honest.

When we get home, I go upstairs to the bathroom. I need to see the note again. I need to remember why I wrote it.

I press the loose tile behind the toilet. It rocks under my hand. I pull it forward slightly, reach behind it.

Nothing.

I press harder, reach further. Check the tile next to it. Check the one below.

Nothing.

The note is gone.

Or maybe I hid it somewhere else. Or maybe I never hid it at all. Maybe I imagined the whole thing.

I sit on the bathroom floor with my back against the cold tile wall and try to remember. The note. My handwriting. DON'T TRUST HIM.

Was it real?

Downstairs, I can hear David and Claire talking, their voices low and serious. I can't make out the words.

I should go down there. I should ask what they're discussing. I should demand to be part of the conversation about my own life.

Instead, I stay on the bathroom floor and wonder if I'm losing my mind.

And if I am—if this is real, if the diagnosis is right, if I'm following my mother into the fog—then why would I write myself a warning?

What did I know when I wrote it?

What am I forgetting now?
