  - She hides the notebook.
  - The entry is dated from today.

## KEY STORY ELEMENTS

**Major Twists:**
1. **Chapter 20:** David knows Claire's real identity; he's been playing both of them
2. **Chapter 34:** Emma reveals she has real dementia AND was being drugged—both things are true
3. **Chapter 40:** Emma's final journal suggests she might be more lucid than anyone knows—or proves she's truly lost

**Dual POV Progression:**
- **Emma's chapters:** Start fragmented, become clearer mid-book as drugs leave her system, then fragment again as real dementia progresses—BUT final chapter suggests possible hidden lucidity
- **Claire's chapters:** Start controlled and observational, become increasingly emotional and conflicted, end with hard-won peace

**Character Arcs:**
- **Emma:** Victim → Fighter → Survivor → ? (ambiguous)
- **Claire:** Avenger → Protector → Grieving sister who finally lets go
- **David:** Charming husband → Revealed monster → Convicted killer (but threat lingers)

**Thematic Resolution:**
- Can you be unreliable AND right? YES
- Can you survive losing your mind? YES—but at a cost
- What's the difference between justice and revenge? The story explores both
- The cruelest prison is your own mind
- Belief matters—Claire believing Emma saved them both

---

**NOTES FOR WRITING:**
- Alternate Emma/Claire chapters strictly
- Emma's prose should reflect her mental state (fragmented when drugged, clearer when not)
- Claire's prose is controlled but has cracks showing emotional strain
- Use dates/timestamps to show Emma's time loss
- Plant clues early that can be reinterpreted after twists
- The house is a character—beautiful, cold, prison-like
- Rebecca haunts the narrative through objects, spaces, parallels
- Every chapter must end on a hook/tension beat
- Balance psychological horror with thriller pacing
- The reader should constantly question what's real
- Honor the complexity of actual dementia while using it in thriller context
- The final ambiguity is intentional—some questions aren't answered
