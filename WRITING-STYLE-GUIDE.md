## Core Prose Philosophy

**Longer prose that doesn't sound poetic.**

This is a novel, not a poem.

- Prioritize clarity and tension over lyrical language
- Build atmosphere through action and character psychology, not flowery descriptions
- Let the story breathe with well-developed scenes
- Avoid overly compressed, "literary" sentences that sacrifice readability

## Hooks: Starting Chapters Strong

### What Makes a Strong Hook

A hook should:
- Start with tension, not explanation
- Drop the reader into a moment of disruption
- Use character voice, not plot summary
- Ask an implicit question

### DO: Hook Techniques

**Start with tension, not explanation.**
- Someone is hiding something. Someone lied. Something is already broken.

**Drop the reader into a moment of disruption.**
- Life before the problem is boring. Life because of the problem is the story.

**Use character voice, not plot summary.**
- A hook is strongest when it feels personal, not informational.

**Ask an implicit question.**
- Not: *This town had secrets.*
- Better: *Everyone said the disappearance was an accident. Everyone except him.*

### DON'T: Hook Anti-Patterns

**Don't start with weather unless the weather is murdering someone.**
- Rain doesn't create suspense. Context does.

**Don't dump backstory in paragraph two like a drunk raccoon tipping a trash can.**
- Mystery thrives on restraint.

**Don't rely on cheap shock without emotional meaning.**
- "There was blood everywhere." Okay... and? Whose? Why should I care?

## Cliffhangers: Ending Chapters with Impact

### Core Principles

Cliffhangers must:
- End on a sharp note that compels the reader to continue
- Provide variety in execution across chapters
- Feel earned, not manipulative
- Grow from character choices, not random chaos

### DO: Cliffhanger Techniques

**End a chapter with a shift, not a scream.**
- A new realization
- A wrong assumption exposed
- A threat quietly entering the frame

**Cut right before the answer.**
- Let readers stew.

**Let the cliffhanger grow from character choices, not random chaos.**
- It should feel inevitable and horrible, like watching a slow-motion train crash.

**Keep them earned.**
- The reader should think: *I should've seen that coming.*
- Not: *What the hell was that?*

**Ensure variety.**
- Don't use the same type of cliffhanger repeatedly
- Mix emotional reveals, physical threats, psychological shifts, and relationship fractures

### DON'T: Cliffhanger Anti-Patterns

**Don't use the "fake threat" trick too often.**

Example of sins:
- "Someone grabbed her shoulder—just the cat!"

Readers forgive that once. Maybe twice. After that, they want to throw the book into traffic.

**Don't stall the payoff forever.**
- If every chapter ends with a tease and no chapter answers anything, you get hate-read vibes.

**Don't cliffhanger basic info.**

Example:
- "She opened the envelope and gasped."
- And then the chapter ends.

If I need to wait two pages just to learn it was a birthday card, I will haunt your house.

## Avoiding Clichés in Psychological/Domestic Thrillers

### Common Sins to Avoid

**The "mysterious new neighbor" who is obviously the villain.**
- If you use this trope, subvert it meaningfully.

**The "woman who swears she's being watched but no one believes her."**
- Still usable, but give it a fresh angle.
- Avoid making her completely helpless or purely reactive.

**The "journal found with cryptic entries."**
- If you use this, the entries better do more than be vague threats and melodrama.
- Give the journal real character voice and specific details.

### Critical Reminder

**Readers in this genre are bloodhounds. If something smells familiar, they'll know.**

The best twists and reveals come from character-specific details, not genre conventions.

## The Real Danger

Make hooks and cliffhangers feel **intimate, personal, and tied to emotional stakes.**

The danger isn't the house being haunted.

**The danger is the marriage.**

Focus on:
- Relationships fracturing
- Trust being violated
- Identity being questioned
- Safety within the home being compromised
- The slow erosion of certainty

The external threats matter only insofar as they force internal reckonings.

## Implementation Notes for NPE System

When generating chapters:
1. **Hooks**: Review the opening paragraph of each chapter against the DO/DON'T criteria
2. **Cliffhangers**: Track cliffhanger types across chapters to ensure variety
3. **Clichés**: Cross-reference plot elements against the common sins list
4. **Emotional stakes**: Always tie tension to character relationships and psychology, not just plot mechanics
