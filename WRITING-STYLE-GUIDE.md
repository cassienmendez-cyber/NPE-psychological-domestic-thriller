# Writing Style Guide

## Narrative Physics Engine Style Preferences

This document defines the writing style standards for all manuscripts generated by the NPE system.

---

## Core Prose Philosophy

**Longer prose that doesn't sound poetic.**

This is a novel, not a poem.

- Prioritize clarity and tension over lyrical language
- Build atmosphere through action and character psychology, not flowery descriptions
- Let the story breathe with well-developed scenes
- Avoid overly compressed, "literary" sentences that sacrifice readability

---

## Hooks: Starting Chapters Strong

### What Makes a Strong Hook

A hook should:
- Start with tension, not explanation
- Drop the reader into a moment of disruption
- Use character voice, not plot summary
- Ask an implicit question

### DO: Hook Techniques

**Start with tension, not explanation.**
- Someone is hiding something. Someone lied. Something is already broken.

**Drop the reader into a moment of disruption.**
- Life before the problem is boring. Life because of the problem is the story.

**Use character voice, not plot summary.**
- A hook is strongest when it feels personal, not informational.

**Ask an implicit question.**
- Not: *This town had secrets.*
- Better: *Everyone said the disappearance was an accident. Everyone except him.*

### DON'T: Hook Anti-Patterns

**Don't start with weather unless the weather is murdering someone.**
- Rain doesn't create suspense. Context does.

**Don't dump backstory in paragraph two like a drunk raccoon tipping a trash can.**
- Mystery thrives on restraint.

**Don't rely on cheap shock without emotional meaning.**
- "There was blood everywhere." Okay... and? Whose? Why should I care?

## Cliffhangers: Ending Chapters with Impact

### Core Principles

Cliffhangers must:
- End on a sharp note that compels the reader to continue
- Provide variety in execution across chapters
- Feel earned, not manipulative
- Grow from character choices, not random chaos

### DO: Cliffhanger Techniques

**End a chapter with a shift, not a scream.**
- A new realization
- A wrong assumption exposed
- A threat quietly entering the frame

**Cut right before the answer.**
- Let readers stew.

**Let the cliffhanger grow from character choices, not random chaos.**
- It should feel inevitable and horrible, like watching a slow-motion train crash.

**Keep them earned.**
- The reader should think: *I should've seen that coming.*
- Not: *What the hell was that?*

**Ensure variety.**
- Don't use the same type of cliffhanger repeatedly
- Mix emotional reveals, physical threats, psychological shifts, and relationship fractures

### DON'T: Cliffhanger Anti-Patterns

**Don't use the "fake threat" trick too often.**

Example of sins:
- "Someone grabbed her shoulder—just the cat!"

Readers forgive that once. Maybe twice. After that, they want to throw the book into traffic.

**Don't stall the payoff forever.**
- If every chapter ends with a tease and no chapter answers anything, you get hate-read vibes.

**Don't cliffhanger basic info.**

Example:
- "She opened the envelope and gasped."
- And then the chapter ends.

If I need to wait two pages just to learn it was a birthday card, I will haunt your house.

## Avoiding Clichés in Psychological/Domestic Thrillers

### Common Sins to Avoid

**The "mysterious new neighbor" who is obviously the villain.**
- If you use this trope, subvert it meaningfully.

**The "woman who swears she's being watched but no one believes her."**
- Still usable, but give it a fresh angle.
- Avoid making her completely helpless or purely reactive.

**The "journal found with cryptic entries."**
- If you use this, the entries better do more than be vague threats and melodrama.
- Give the journal real character voice and specific details.

### Critical Reminder

**Readers in this genre are bloodhounds. If something smells familiar, they'll know.**

The best twists and reveals come from character-specific details, not genre conventions.

---

## The Real Danger

Make hooks and cliffhangers feel **intimate, personal, and tied to emotional stakes.**

The danger isn't the house being haunted.

**The danger is the marriage.**

Focus on:
- Relationships fracturing
- Trust being violated
- Identity being questioned
- Safety within the home being compromised
- The slow erosion of certainty

The external threats matter only insofar as they force internal reckonings.

---

## Repetition Avoidance: Pre-Chapter Analysis

**CRITICAL AUTOMATION STEP**: Before drafting any chapter, the system MUST analyze all previously written text and create a repetition-avoidance plan.

### The Problem

AI-generated prose falls into predictable patterns:
- Overused physical gestures (throat tightening, breath catching, jaw clenching)
- Repetitive emotional language (heart pounding, stomach churning)
- Identical sentence structures
- Recycled sensory details and metaphors

A 40-chapter manuscript written without variation awareness becomes monotonous and reveals its AI origins.

### The Solution: Pre-Writing Analysis Protocol

**Before writing each chapter, the system must:**

1. **Analyze the text above** (all previous chapters)
2. **Create a brief repetition-avoidance plan**
3. **Execute the chapter using that plan**

### Repetition-Avoidance Plan Components

The plan must identify and document:

#### 1. Overused Gestures or Emotional Language to Avoid

**Scan for patterns such as:**
- Physical reactions (e.g., "her stomach dropped," "his jaw tightened," "breath caught")
- Emotional descriptors (e.g., "anxiety spiked," "dread pooled," "fear crept")
- Character tics that have appeared more than 2-3 times
- Dialogue tags beyond "said/asked" that are becoming repetitive

**Output format:**
```
AVOID IN THIS CHAPTER:
- "stomach dropped/churned/tightened" (used 7x in Ch 1-5)
- Characters "swallowing hard" (used 5x)
- "Blood ran cold" variations (used 3x)
```

#### 2. Sentence Patterns That Should Vary

**Identify structural repetition:**
- Chapters that start the same way (e.g., always waking up, always with dialogue)
- Overuse of short declarative sentences
- Overuse of fragments for emphasis
- Repetitive paragraph lengths (all short or all long)
- Overreliance on rhetorical questions

**Output format:**
```
VARY SENTENCE PATTERNS:
- Last 3 chapters started with dialogue → start with action/internal thought
- Chapter 4 used 15 fragments for tension → limit fragments to 5 max
- Overusing: "She knew X. But Y." pattern → find new contrast structures
```

#### 3. New Sensory Cues, Metaphors, and Emotional Angles to Introduce

**Actively plan freshness:**
- What senses haven't been used recently? (taste, smell, temperature, texture)
- What new metaphors fit this chapter's emotional tone?
- What emotional angle hasn't been explored? (shame vs. fear, numbness vs. panic)
- What new physical settings allow new sensory vocabulary?

**Output format:**
```
INTRODUCE IN THIS CHAPTER:
- Sensory: Use smell (coffee, perfume, decay) — underused so far
- Metaphor: Explore "water/drowning" imagery (fresh angle for overwhelm)
- Emotional: Focus on humiliation rather than fear (new territory)
- Physical: Kitchen setting → temperature, textures, sounds of cooking
```

### Example Pre-Chapter Analysis Output

```markdown
## Chapter 6 Repetition-Avoidance Plan

**ANALYZE CHAPTERS 1-5:**

AVOID:
- "Throat tightened" (6x), "stomach dropped" (4x), "breath caught" (5x)
- Characters biting lips, clenching fists (overused physical tells)
- "She told herself" internal thought pattern (8x)

VARY:
- Last 2 chapters started with Emma waking → start mid-scene
- Overusing short paragraphs for tension → add 2-3 longer flowing paragraphs
- Too many rhetorical questions in Ch 5 → limit to 1-2 max

INTRODUCE:
- Sensory: Taste (wine, food textures), temperature (cold hands, hot room)
- Metaphor: "Glass/shattering" imagery for relationship fracture
- Emotional: Focus on resentment building, not just fear/anxiety
- Physical: Dinner party setting → sounds of conversation, clinking glasses
```

### Implementation in NPE Workflow

**This analysis must happen:**

1. **Before every chapter draft** (not after, not during revision)
2. **As the first step** in the chapter generation process
3. **Documented in the chapter file** as a comment block or separate analysis file
4. **Referenced actively** during the writing process

**Integration with draft-chapters.py:**

```python
# Pseudo-code for automation
def draft_chapter(chapter_num, previous_chapters):
    # Step 1: Analyze previous text
    repetition_analysis = analyze_repetition(previous_chapters)

    # Step 2: Create avoidance plan
    avoidance_plan = create_avoidance_plan(repetition_analysis)

    # Step 3: Draft chapter with plan as constraint
    chapter_text = generate_chapter(
        chapter_num=chapter_num,
        story_context=get_story_context(),
        avoidance_plan=avoidance_plan  # ← Key constraint
    )

    return chapter_text
```

### Quality Metrics

After implementing this system, manuscripts should show:
- **Gesture diversity**: No single physical reaction used more than 5x across 40 chapters
- **Sentence variety**: Mix of short/long, simple/complex, declarative/questions
- **Sensory richness**: All 5 senses engaged across the book, not just sight/sound
- **Emotional range**: 10+ distinct emotional states explored (not just fear/anxiety)
- **Metaphor freshness**: No metaphor system (darkness, water, etc.) dominates excessively

## Implementation Notes for NPE System

When generating chapters:
1. **Pre-Chapter Analysis**: ALWAYS run repetition-avoidance analysis before drafting (see section above)
2. **Hooks**: Review the opening paragraph of each chapter against the DO/DON'T criteria
3. **Cliffhangers**: Track cliffhanger types across chapters to ensure variety
4. **Clichés**: Cross-reference plot elements against the common sins list
5. **Emotional stakes**: Always tie tension to character relationships and psychology, not just plot mechanics
