# NANNY FROM HELL

## Core Concept
Trusted caregiver (nanny, babysitter, au pair) hired to help family actually has sinister agenda: replacing the mother, harming children, stealing family's life, or covering darker crimes. Exploits parents' desperation for help and guilt about needing it. Classic domestic thriller scenario.

## Psychological Foundation
Taps into parental fears about leaving children with strangers, guilt about needing help, and vulnerability of inviting someone into intimate family space. Questions: Who is this person we've trusted with our children? What are they doing when we're not watching?

## Key Characteristics / Techniques

- Creates dependency (children love her, partner relies on her)

- Protagonist (usually mother) notices concerning signs
- Others dismiss mother's concerns (husband, family, friends)
- Nanny may: drug children, isolate mother, seduce father, steal identity, harm children
- Mother's attempts to fire nanny backfire
- Climax forces confrontation when mother discovers true agenda
