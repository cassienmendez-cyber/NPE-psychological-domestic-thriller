## Example Application
The Morrison family seems perfect: beautiful home, successful parents, accomplished children, active in community. New neighbor (protagonist) befriends teenage daughter who accidentally reveals truth: father is abusive, mother medicates to cope, children are controlled through fear and financial leverage. Family desperately maintains facade for father's political career. Protagonist must decide whether to expose them, help daughter escape, or mind own business. Father will do anything to protect image. Climax forces public exposure when daughter runs away and protagonist harbors her.
