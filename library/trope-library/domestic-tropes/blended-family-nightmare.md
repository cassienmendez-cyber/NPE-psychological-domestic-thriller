# BLENDED FAMILY NIGHTMARE

## Core Concept
New marriage creates blended family where step-parent, step-sibling, or step-child brings danger, secrets, or malicious intent. Family members don't know each other well, creating vulnerability. Loyalty conflicts between biological and new family members.

## Key Characteristics
- New marriage combines families quickly
- Step-family member has hidden agenda or darkness
- Biological parent doesn't believe child's concerns
- Step-parent undermines or harms step-child
- Or step-child targets step-parent to eliminate them
- Biological bonds vs. new family loyalty conflict
- Evidence dismissed as "adjustment issues"

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** New blended family, initial adjustment struggles
**Escalation:** Concerning incidents dismissed, danger becomes clear
**Payoff:** Truth exposed, family must choose sides, protection or dissolution

## Compatible Elements
✅ Step-parent antagonist, child-in-danger, family secrets, inheritance motives
⚠️ Stereotyping step-families, making all step-relationships suspect
❌ Evil step-mother fairy tale clichés without depth

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
Mother remarries man with teenage son. Her young daughter claims step-brother is hurting her, but evidence is ambiguous and mother thinks she's jealous. Step-brother is actually predatory. Or reverse: step-father is abusive and biological parent doesn't believe child. Family loyalty conflicts create danger as one parent protects child while other protects new spouse.
