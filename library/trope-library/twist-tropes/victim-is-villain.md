# VICTIM IS VILLAIN

## Core Concept
The person presented as victim throughout the story is revealed to be the actual antagonist/perpetrator. Classic twist that forces reader to reinterpret all previous events through new lens. Protagonist (and reader) have been manipulated into sympathizing with and helping the true villain.

## Psychological Foundation
Exploits natural human empathy and tendency to believe victims. Questions our ability to judge character and read situations. Reveals how skilled manipulators use victim status as weapon.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- "Victim" presents convincing case of being targeted/harmed
- Protagonist helps or protects them
- Small inconsistencies in victim's story (clues for re-read)
- Victim isolates actual victims or turns others against them
- Reveal shows "victim" orchestrated everything
- May involve false accusations, staged attacks, fabricated evidence
- True victims have been gaslit or framed

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** Establish sympathetic victim, cruel antagonist (who is actual victim)
**Escalation:** Protagonist helps "victim," situation worsens for real victim
**Payoff:** Truth revealed, protagonist must undo damage, "victim" exposed

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with: Unreliable narrator, gaslighting, false accusations, dual POV, legal/custody battles
⚠️ Careful with: Not undermining all victims, making twist believable, cluing fairly
❌ Avoid: No setup/pure shock value, victim-blaming implications

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
Woman claims neighbor is stalking her, shows "evidence," gets restraining order. Protagonist befriends her, helps build case. Neighbor (actual victim) seems suspicious and defensive. Twist: "victim" is obsessed with neighbor, fabricated all evidence, has been stalking and framing them. Protagonist realizes they helped destroy innocent person's life.
