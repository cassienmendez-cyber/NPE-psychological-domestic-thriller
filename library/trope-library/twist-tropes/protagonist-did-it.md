# PROTAGONIST DID IT

## Core Concept
Protagonist has been investigating crime/mystery, only to discover they're the perpetrator. May involve: amnesia, dissociation, sleepwalking, blackouts, or deliberate self-deception. Ultimate unreliable narrator twist.

## Key Characteristics
- Protagonist investigates mystery they caused
- Memory gaps or lost time
- Evidence points to them but they don't remember
- May have psychological condition causing blackouts
- Or consciously suppressed guilt/memory
- Reader may suspect before protagonist realizes
- Final revelation forces protagonist to face what they've done

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** Establish mystery and protagonist's investigation, hint at memory issues
**Escalation:** Evidence against others weak, protagonist's alibis shaky
**Payoff:** Protagonist discovers truth about themselves

## Compatible Elements

⚠️ Mental illness portrayal, making it believable
❌ Cheap twist without setup, exploiting mental illness

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
