- Police investigation inadequate or suspicious
- Protagonist investigates, discovers secrets about missing person
- Multiple suspects or theories
- Missing person may have left clues

⚠️ Careful with: Missing child plots (tone), coincidence in finding them

## Example Application
Protagonist's husband doesn't come home from work. His car is found abandoned. Police investigation stalls. As she searches, she discovers he's been living double life: secret apartment, second phone, large cash withdrawals, connection to dangerous people. She must find him while uncovering who he really is. Twist: he witnessed crime and went into hiding to protect family, or he staged disappearance to escape something.
