# HOME INVASION

## Core Concept
Protagonist's home—the ultimate safe space—is violated by intruder(s), creating primal fear through loss of sanctuary. Can be single violent event or slow realization someone has been entering home repeatedly. Particularly effective in domestic thrillers because home represents safety, privacy, and control.

## Psychological Foundation
Taps into fear of violated boundaries and loss of safe space. Home is where we're most vulnerable (sleeping, unguarded). Invasion creates lasting trauma even after physical threat ends. Questions: Who was here? What did they touch? Will they come back?

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Protagonist discovers evidence of intrusion (moved objects, missing items, foreign smells)
- Or: violent break-in forcing confrontation
- Home security measures fail or are circumvented
- Protagonist's sense of safety permanently altered
- May involve: burglary, stalker, revenge, terror tactics
- Climax often forces protagonist to defend home/family
- Aftermath addresses trauma of violated sanctuary

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** Establish home as safe haven, first subtle signs of intrusion
**Escalation:** Evidence mounts, protagonist's fear grows, security measures fail, confrontation approaches
**Payoff:** Protagonist must defend home/self, intruder's motive revealed, reclaim or abandon violated space

## Compatible Elements

⚠️ Careful with: Home invasion torture porn, gratuitous violence
❌ Avoid: Easy police solution, victim-blaming security failures

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
