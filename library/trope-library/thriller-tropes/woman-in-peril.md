# WOMAN IN PERIL

## Core Concept
Female protagonist faces escalating danger, often in domestic or familiar settings. Classic thriller trope that taps into societal vulnerabilities women face. Modern versions subvert by making woman active hero rather than passive victim.

## Psychological Foundation
Exploits real fears women experience: domestic violence, stalking, loss of safety in own home. Creates identification for female readers, tension for all readers. Works because threat is often someone who should be safe (partner, neighbor, family).

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Protagonist is woman alone or isolated
- Threat escalates from psychological to physical
- Domestic setting made unsafe
- May involve: stalking, home invasion, abusive relationship, trapped in dangerous situation
- Modern versions: woman fights back, uses intelligence to survive
- Often intersects with other tropes (gaslighting, domestic abuse)

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** Establish woman's normal life and emerging threat
**Escalation:** Safe spaces violated, isolation increases, danger intensifies
**Payoff:** Woman must save herself (modern) or be rescued (traditional); survival and reclaiming agency

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with: Home invasion, stalker plots, domestic abuse, isolated settings, woman protecting children
⚠️ Careful with: Gratuitous violence, disempowering protagonist, gender stereotypes
❌ Avoid: Woman as pure victim without agency, torture porn, damsel rescued by man trope

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Gothic: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application

Sarah must protect herself and her daughter while trapped in her own home overnight during a storm. She uses intelligence, household items, and knowledge of her home's layout to survive and ultimately trap her attacker. She's active hero, not passive victim, but faces real terror and danger throughout.
