# PARANOIA SPIRAL

## Core Concept
The protagonist's anxiety and suspicion escalate in a self-reinforcing cycle where their hypervigilance finds threats everywhere, their investigation creates more suspicious circumstances, and their behavior becomes increasingly erratic—making others question their stability, which increases their paranoia further. The trope works whether the threats are real, imagined, or a mix.

## Psychological Foundation
Based on confirmation bias, hypervigilance, and self-fulfilling prophecy. When someone looks for threats, they find patterns everywhere. Their defensive behavior makes others react negatively, confirming their suspicions. Sleep deprivation and stress compromise judgment, intensifying the spiral.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Protagonist becomes increasingly suspicious of everyone
- Sleep deprivation amplifies fears and distorted thinking
- Normal events reinterpreted as threatening
- Protagonist's behavior becomes erratic or aggressive
- Others' concern interpreted as part of conspiracy
- Investigation methods become questionable or illegal
- Physical and mental health deteriorate visibly
- May involve charts, obsessive note-taking, connecting unrelated events
- Isolation increases as protagonist pushes people away
- Climax reveals actual truth (threat real, imagined, or mixed)

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** Protagonist with anxiety/trauma baseline, initial legitimate concern
**Escalation:** Small incident → investigation → more "evidence" → increasing paranoia → reckless behavior → isolation → breakdown
**Payoff:** Truth revealed, protagonist must reckon with their actions, may vindicate them or reveal delusion

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with: Anxious protagonists, isolated settings, gaslighting, conspiracy theories, surveillance themes
⚠️ Careful with: Mental illness portrayal, protagonist becoming unsympathetic
❌ Avoid: Complete vindication without addressing harmful behavior, using mental illness as simple twist

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
After a home break-in, protagonist Anna becomes hypervigilant. She installs cameras, researches neighbors obsessively, connects random incidents into conspiracy. Her sleep-deprived investigations make her act erratically. Neighbors become concerned; she interprets this as guilt. She breaks into a neighbor's home looking for evidence. The climax reveals there was a real threat (one neighbor is a burglar) but her paranoia created false patterns and nearly destroyed innocent lives. She must face consequences of her actions while being partially vindicated.
