# GASLIGHTING

## Core Concept
A form of psychological manipulation where one person systematically causes another to question their own reality, memory, perception, and sanity. The gaslighter denies facts, contradicts the victim's memory, and gradually erodes their confidence in their own judgment. Named after the 1944 film "Gaslight," this is a cornerstone trope of psychological thrillers, particularly effective in domestic settings.

## Psychological Foundation
Works by exploiting the victim's trust, desire to believe their partner/friend/family member, and natural tendency to doubt themselves when faced with confident contradiction. Repeated gaslighting creates learned helplessness where victim stops trusting their own perceptions. The victim's isolation (common in gaslighting situations) means no outside reality-check is available.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Denying conversations or events that definitely occurred
- Insisting victim said or did things they didn't
- Moving or hiding objects then claiming victim moved/lost them
- Telling victim their memory is faulty or they're "crazy"
- Enlisting others to validate gaslighter's version
- Escalating from small denials to major reality distortions
- Using victim's past mistakes or mental health against them
- Presenting as concerned about victim's deteriorating memory/sanity
- Victim starts recording conversations or keeping evidence secretly

## Narrative Use
**Setup requirements:**
- Establish normal baseline of reality
- Show the relationship before gaslighting begins
- Victim needs reason to trust gaslighter initially
- Small denials that seem like misunderstandings first

**Escalation pattern:**
- Minor memory disagreements (victim dismisses)
- Increasing frequency and importance of denied events
- Victim questions own memory, starts keeping notes
- Others validate gaslighter, victim feels isolated
- Victim discovers evidence proving gaslighter is lying
- Confrontation where gaslighter doubles down
- Victim must choose: trust self or maintain relationship

**Payoff considerations:**
- Victim must ultimately trust themselves over gaslighter
- Often includes proof that vindicates victim (recording, witness, evidence)
- Gaslighter's motivation should be revealed
- Resolution requires victim reclaiming their reality

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with:
- Gaslighted spouse protagonists
- Anxious protagonists (more vulnerable to self-doubt)
- Charming manipulator antagonists
- Inheritance/financial motive plots
- Isolated settings
- Secret recordings/evidence discovery
- Unreliable narrator (victim's perspective)
- Dual POV revealing gaslighter's calculation

⚠️ Requires careful handling with:
- Not making victim seem stupid or weak
- Showing it can happen to anyone
- Avoiding confusion with actual memory issues
- Making gaslighter's success believable

❌ Avoid combining with:
- Protagonist actually has faulty memory (undermines)
- Easy immediate belief when victim tells others
- Gaslighter admits it and apologizes (too simple)

## Example Application
Emily notices her car keys are in different places than she left them. Her husband Mark says she's been forgetful lately, must be stress. Then she can't find her phone—Mark says she left it at the office (she knows she didn't). Money disappears from their account; Mark shows her a receipt with her signature for expensive purchases she doesn't remember making. When Emily insists she didn't buy anything, Mark gently suggests she see a doctor about her memory. Her mother-in-law mentions Mark told her Emily's been "having trouble." Emily starts recording conversations on a hidden device. She discovers Mark has been deliberately moving her things, forging signatures, and orchestrating her "memory problems" to make her appear mentally unstable—all to gain power of attorney and access her inheritance. The recordings become crucial evidence.

## Chapter-Level Beats
- **Ch 1-5:** First minor incidents, Emily dismisses as misunderstandings
- **Ch 6-10:** Pattern emerges, Emily questions herself, Mark seems concerned
- **Ch 11-15:** Emily secretly documents reality, finds contradictions
- **Ch 16-20:** Confrontation, Mark gaslights harder, Emily discovers recordings/proof
- **Ch 21-30:** Emily investigates Mark's motive, he escalates, others validate him
- **Ch 31-37:** Climax, Emily's proof revealed, Mark's plan exposed
- **Ch 38-40:** Emily reclaims reality, Mark faces consequences, she rebuilds trust in herself
