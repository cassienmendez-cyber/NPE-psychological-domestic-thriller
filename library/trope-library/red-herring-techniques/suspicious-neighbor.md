# SUSPICIOUS NEIGHBOR

## Core Concept
Neighbor exhibits concerning behavior that seems to indicate they're the threat, drawing protagonist's (and reader's) suspicion away from real danger. Classic red herring in domestic thrillers. May be genuinely odd but harmless, or hiding something unrelated to main plot.

## Key Characteristics
- Neighbor has suspicious habits (watches protagonist, odd hours, secretive)
- Protagonist investigates, finds concerning details
- Evidence seems to implicate neighbor
- Plot threads suggest neighbor is antagonist
- Reveal: neighbor's suspicious behavior has innocent or unrelated explanation
- Real threat was elsewhere, often closer than suspected

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** Introduce neighbor with suspicious traits
**Escalation:** Evidence against neighbor mounts
**Payoff:** Reveal neighbor's innocence/irrelevance, redirect to real threat

## Compatible Elements
✅ Mystery plots, multiple suspects, misdirection, suburban settings
⚠️ Making neighbor's behavior believably suspicious yet innocent
❌ Dropping neighbor thread without resolution

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
New neighbor is reclusive, watches protagonist's house at odd hours, has strange visitors. Protagonist suspects him of stalking or planning crime. Investigation reveals: he's in witness protection, was watching to ensure his safety, strange visitors are federal agents. Real threat is protagonist's trusted friend.
