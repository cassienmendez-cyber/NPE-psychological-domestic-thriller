# WRONG PERSON ALL ALONG

## Core Concept
Protagonist (and reader) have been focused on wrong suspect/threat while real danger was elsewhere. Misdirection technique that makes final reveal more surprising and forces reevaluation of all previous evidence.

## Key Characteristics
- Obvious suspect draws attention
- Evidence seems to point convincingly to them
- Protagonist invests time investigating wrong person
- Meanwhile, real antagonist operates freely
- May involve: identical twin, wrong sibling, wrong spouse, wrong neighbor
- Reveal shows how evidence was misinterpreted
- Real threat often closer/more trusted than suspected person

## Narrative Use
**Setup:** Establish obvious suspect with concerning evidence
**Escalation:** Build case against wrong person
**Payoff:** Reveal true antagonist, show how misdirection worked

## Compatible Elements
✅ Red herrings, twist endings, dual POV showing truth, hidden antagonist
⚠️ Must be fairly clued, not cheap trick
❌ No setup or explanation, purely random switch

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
Protagonist suspects husband's business partner of embezzlement and threat to family. All evidence points to partner. But twist reveals: it's been husband all along, deliberately framing partner. Or: blames wrong identical twin, evidence fit both.
