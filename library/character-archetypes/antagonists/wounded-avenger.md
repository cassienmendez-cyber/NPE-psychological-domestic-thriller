# WOUNDED AVENGER

## Core Concept
An antagonist driven by past trauma or injustice who seeks revenge against the protagonist or their family for real or perceived wrongs. They've nursed their grievance for years, and their pain has twisted into obsession and rage. They believe their actions are justified retribution. The protagonist may be innocent, complicit, or completely unaware of the original wound. This creates tension between understanding the antagonist's pain and condemning their actions.

## Psychological Foundation / Motivation
Motivated by need for revenge, justice (in their view), or evening the score. Past trauma or wrong has consumed them, becoming their identity. Unable to move forward or heal, they've directed all energy into vengeance. May have legitimate grievance but response is disproportionate. Views protagonist as responsible (directly or indirectly) for their suffering. Revenge has become their only purpose, even if self-destructive.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Consumed by past trauma or injustice
- Long-term planning for revenge (sometimes years)
- Views their actions as morally justified
- Wants protagonist to understand their pain before they act
- May target protagonist's loved ones to mirror their own loss
- Detailed knowledge of protagonist's life (stalking behavior)
- Flashbacks or references to inciting incident
- May give protagonist chances to apologize or acknowledge wrong
- Escalating acts designed to cause maximum pain, not just destruction
- Often willing to sacrifice themselves for revenge

## Narrative Use
**Setup requirements:**
- Establish mysterious threat to protagonist with personal quality
- Reveal antagonist's connection to past event gradually
- Show antagonist's pain and trauma to create complexity
- Clarify protagonist's actual level of culpability
- Build sympathy for antagonist's wound while condemning methods

**Escalation pattern:**
- Initial mysterious threats or attacks
- Clues to past connection emerge
- Antagonist reveals themselves and their grievance
- Escalates from symbolic to actual harm
- Targets what protagonist loves most
- May offer protagonist chance to prevent final act
- Reaches climax where revenge is nearly complete
- Protagonist must address both current threat and past wrong

**Payoff considerations:**
- Must acknowledge antagonist's legitimate pain
- But can't excuse their actions
- Resolution often involves protagonist understanding past
- May end with antagonist's self-destruction
- Or protagonist preventing revenge while acknowledging wrong
- Sometimes involves breaking cycle of vengeance

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with:
- Past event reveals (through flashbacks or investigation)
- Protagonist with hidden guilt or connection to past
- Dual timeline structure (past and present)
- Sympathetic villain complexity
- Family sins visited on next generation
- School, workplace, or community past incidents
- Accidental harm or injustice protagonist didn't realize
- Class or power dynamics from past

⚠️ Requires careful handling with:
- Balance between sympathy and accountability
- Protagonist's actual guilt level
- Not glorifying revenge
- Avoiding trauma exploitation

❌ Avoid combining with:
- Complete vindication of revenge plot
- Protagonist being entirely innocent but punished anyway
- Easy forgiveness without consequences
- Dismissing antagonist's pain as mere "craziness"

## Example Application
Fifteen years ago, Claire's husband was driving drunk and killed a pedestrian—a single mother named Anne. He served minimal jail time due to good lawyers. Anne's daughter Emma, then 10, went into foster care and endured abuse. Now Emma is back, using a different name, having inserted herself into Claire's life as a friend. Claire doesn't recognize her. Emma has been systematically destroying Claire's marriage, reputation, and career. She plans to take everything from Claire the way Claire's husband took her mother. As the protagonist uncovers who Emma is, she faces her own complicity—she helped her husband craft his defense, blamed the victim, never reached out to the daughter. Emma's pain is real and justified, but her methods have become monstrous. Claire must acknowledge the past harm while stopping Emma from destroying innocent people (Claire's children). The climax involves Claire accepting responsibility while preventing Emma from completing her revenge.
