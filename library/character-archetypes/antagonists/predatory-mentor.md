# PREDATORY MENTOR

## Core Concept
A trusted authority figure (teacher, boss, therapist, coach, religious leader) who uses their position of power to groom, manipulate, and exploit the protagonist or someone protagonist cares about. They present as caring, supportive, and invested in their mentee's growth, but are actually exploiting vulnerability for personal gain (sexual, financial, psychological, or power). The abuse of trust and authority makes this particularly insidious.

## Psychological Foundation / Motivation
Motivated by power, control, sexual gratification, financial gain, or narcissistic supply. Uses position of authority to access vulnerable targets. May genuinely believe they're special or entitled to this power. Views mentees/students as objects for use. Often has pattern of targeting vulnerable individuals. May rationalize behavior as "special connection" or "helping" the victim. Needs to be admired and needed. Threatened by mentee's independence.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Respected authority figure in community
- Identifies vulnerable targets (often isolated, needy for approval)
- Grooms through special attention and boundary erosion
- Creates dependency through praise and criticism cycle
- Isolates mentee from other support/influences
- Presents boundary violations as "special relationship"
- Uses position to make abuse seem consensual or earned
- Has pattern of past victims (often silenced or discredited)
- Maintains impeccable public reputation
- Uses institutional power to protect themselves
- Weaponizes victim's gratitude and need for approval

## Narrative Use
**Setup requirements:**
- Establish their respected position and reputation
- Show protagonist's or loved one's vulnerability and need for guidance
- Demonstrate initial appropriate mentorship before boundary violations
- Plant subtle red flags readers might notice
- Create protagonist's discovery process or protective investigation

**Escalation pattern:**
- Mentorship begins appropriately and helpfully
- Special attention makes mentee feel chosen/special
- Boundaries erode gradually (too personal questions, inappropriate touch)
- Mentee feels confused but wants to maintain relationship
- Mentor isolates mentee from others who might notice
- Abuse escalates (sexual, financial, emotional)
- When questioned, mentor gaslights or threatens
- Protagonist (if not victim) discovers pattern
- Mentor uses power to discredit accusations

**Payoff considerations:**
- Must expose pattern, not just individual incident
- Institution's complicity often part of problem
- Multiple victims may need to unite
- Public exposure and loss of position crucial
- Addresses power dynamics and institutional protection
- Victim's healing begins after exposure

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with:
- Protagonist whose child/loved one is targeted
- School, workplace, or religious settings
- Past victims returning to testify
- Institutional cover-up plots
- Protagonist discovering abuse pattern
- Power dynamic and authority abuse themes
- Grooming process shown gradually
- Legal/police involvement complications

⚠️ Requires careful handling with:
- Sexual abuse content (avoid graphic detail)
- Victim-blaming narratives
- Making abuse seem romantic or consensual
- Respecting real survivors' experiences
- Institutional critique without painting all mentors as dangerous

❌ Avoid combining with:
- Romanticizing or justifying mentor's actions
- Suggesting victims "asked for it"
- Easy institutional accountability (usually they protect abuser)
- False accusation plot twists

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Gothic: ⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
Protagonist Sarah's 17-year-old daughter Chloe is a talented artist mentored by renowned art teacher Mr. Brennan at her private school. He gives Chloe extra studio time, calls her gifted, and gets her into a prestigious summer program. Sarah is grateful until she notices changes—Chloe is secretive, anxious, losing weight. When Sarah questions the close relationship, Chloe says Sarah doesn't understand their "special connection." Sarah investigates and discovers Brennan has a pattern of "mentoring" vulnerable female students. Previous complaints were dismissed or silenced by the school protecting its reputation. Sarah must get Chloe to see the grooming, gather other victims, and expose Brennan despite the school's institutional power protecting him. Chloe initially defends Brennan, believing their relationship is special, making Sarah's fight more complex.

## Chapter-Level Beats
**Chapters 1-5:** Establish Chloe's mentorship with Brennan, Sarah is initially grateful, first concerns
**Chapters 6-10:** Sarah notices Chloe's changes, questions relationship, Chloe defensive, Sarah dismissed
**Chapters 11-15:** Sarah investigates Brennan, finds hints of past incidents, school stonewalls
**Chapters 16-20:** Sarah discovers pattern, Midpoint Twist: learns extent of abuse or finds past victim
**Chapters 21-30:** Sarah must convince Chloe, gather victims, fight institutional protection, Brennan threatens
**Chapters 31-37:** Climactic exposure, multiple victims come forward, Brennan's mask drops, public revelation
**Chapters 38-40:** Resolution, Brennan faces consequences, Chloe begins healing, Sarah processes, system fails/improves
