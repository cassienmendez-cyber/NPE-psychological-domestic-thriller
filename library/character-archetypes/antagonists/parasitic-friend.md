# PARASITIC FRIEND

## Core Concept
A friend (or person who positions themselves as friend) who latches onto the protagonist and gradually takes over their life, identity, relationships, and resources. Initially appearing supportive and devoted, they're actually absorbing and replacing the protagonist. They want what the protagonist has—life, partner, children, career, identity—and systematically work to take it. This is Single White Female / toxic friendship horror.

## Psychological Foundation / Motivation
Motivated by envy, identity disturbance, and desire to become the protagonist or have their life. May have borderline or dependent personality traits. Lacks stable sense of self and tries to merge with or replace protagonist. Views protagonist's life as better/more desirable than own. Often has history of unstable relationships and identity issues. Need for closeness and fear of abandonment drive intrusive behavior. May genuinely believe they'd be better at being the protagonist than protagonist is.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Initially presents as perfect, devoted friend
- Mirrors protagonist's interests, style, mannerisms
- Gradually copies appearance, clothing, speech patterns
- Inserts themselves into protagonist's relationships
- Subtly undermines protagonist while appearing supportive
- Becomes indispensable then weaponizes protagonist's dependence
- Isolates protagonist from other friends
- Boundary violations dismissed as "closeness"
- May seduce protagonist's partner or befriend their children
- Rewrites history to make themselves central to protagonist's life
- Reacts badly to protagonist's boundaries or independence

## Narrative Use
**Setup requirements:**
- Introduce antagonist when protagonist is vulnerable (new town, breakup, new job)
- Show initial friendship as seemingly healthy and supportive
- Plant early boundary violations that seem minor
- Demonstrate protagonist's growing dependence
- Show antagonist's mimicry and intrusion gradually

**Escalation pattern:**
- Friendship becomes all-consuming
- Antagonist copies protagonist's identity markers
- Boundary violations increase
- Antagonist insinuates into protagonist's family, relationships
- When protagonist tries to create distance, antagonist escalates
- May sabotage protagonist's life while "helping"
- Actively works to replace protagonist in their own life
- Becomes dangerous when threatened with loss of connection

**Payoff considerations:**
- Protagonist must reclaim boundaries and identity
- Often ends with antagonist's total breakdown
- May involve antagonist attempting to literally replace protagonist
- Protagonist's support system must be rebuilt
- Resolution requires protagonist asserting independence

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with:
- New-to-area protagonist isolated from old friends
- Recent life transition (divorce, move, job change)
- Protagonist with boundary issues or people-pleasing
- Identity theft or impersonation elements
- Jealousy and envy themes
- Affair with protagonist's partner
- Obsession with protagonist's children
- Social media stalking and mimicry

⚠️ Requires careful handling with:
- Mental illness portrayal without stigmatization
- Balance between victimization and protagonist's agency
- Female friendship dynamics without stereotyping
- Making protagonist's initial trust understandable

❌ Avoid combining with:
- Demonizing all close friendships
- Simple "crazy woman" tropes
- Trivializing personality disorders
- Homophobic "Fatal Attraction" dynamics

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Gothic: ⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
After a difficult divorce, protagonist Lisa moves to a new city. She meets Amber at work—friendly, enthusiastic, seems to really understand her. Amber becomes Lisa's closest friend, helping with the move, always available, supportive. Gradually Lisa notices Amber has started wearing similar clothes, using her phrases, even got the same haircut. Amber befriends Lisa's children, becomes close with Lisa's ex, gets a job at Lisa's company. When Lisa tries to create distance, Amber is hurt and increases contact. Lisa discovers Amber has been sharing details of Lisa's life as her own on social media, has copied Lisa's resume, and has been flirting with Lisa's new boyfriend. Amber has systematically positioned herself to replace Lisa in her own life. When confronted, Amber believes she deserves Lisa's life more than Lisa does. The climax involves Amber attempting to literally take over Lisa's identity while making Lisa look unstable.
