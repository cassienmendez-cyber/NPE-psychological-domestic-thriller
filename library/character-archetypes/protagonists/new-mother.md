# NEW MOTHER

## Core Concept
A woman navigating the overwhelming, isolating, and identity-shifting experience of new motherhood who encounters a genuine threat but struggles to be believed because postpartum symptoms, sleep deprivation, and hormones make her seem "unstable." The horror of being dismissed while trying to protect her baby creates primal terror and rage.

## Psychological Foundation / Motivation
Driven by fierce protective love for her newborn, desire to be a good mother, and need to adjust to massive identity shift. May be experiencing postpartum depression, anxiety, or psychosis, which complicates her ability to trust her own perceptions. Motivated by fear of being judged as an unfit mother and potentially losing her baby. Society's dismissal of new mothers' concerns adds to desperation.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Severe sleep deprivation affecting cognition and perception
- Hypervigilant about baby's safety
- Struggling with identity loss (who she was vs. who she is now)
- Isolated from pre-baby social connections
- Physical recovery from childbirth affecting capability
- Hormonal fluctuations affecting mood and judgment
- Difficulty distinguishing normal new parent anxiety from real threats
- Dismissed by medical professionals, partner, family as "hormonal"
- May have postpartum depression or anxiety symptoms
- Overwhelmed by information and conflicting advice

## Narrative Use
**Setup requirements:**
- Establish the grueling reality of new motherhood honestly
- Show her symptoms of sleep deprivation and/or PPD/PPA
- Demonstrate how others dismiss her concerns
- Introduce ambiguous threat to her or baby
- Create tension between her instincts and others' reassurance

**Escalation pattern:**
- Strange incidents occur but could be explained by exhaustion
- Others attribute her fears to postpartum hormones
- Her symptoms (if any) worsen under stress of investigation
- Evidence emerges but is questioned due to her state
- She loses credibility with partner, doctor, or family
- Must protect baby despite being seen as unstable
- Her protective actions are interpreted as concerning behavior

**Payoff considerations:**
- Threat must be real and her instincts validated
- Must portray postpartum struggles respectfully
- Arc involves learning to trust maternal instincts
- Resolution empowers her as a mother and woman
- Support system must acknowledge they failed her

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with:
- Nanny from hell plots
- Postpartum support group settings
- Medical gaslighting
- Jealous friend/family member antagonists
- Home invasion scenarios
- Baby swap/abduction fears
- Pediatrician/doula antagonists
- Partner who doesn't understand postpartum experience

⚠️ Requires careful handling with:
- Postpartum mental health (avoid stigma)
- Balance between symptoms and capability
- Not using mental health as plot twist villain
- Baby's safety (avoid gratuitous danger)

❌ Avoid combining with:
- Postpartum psychosis as the "real" problem
- Baby as mere plot device
- Dismissive resolution of maternal concerns
- Supernatural/horror elements with real mental health

## Example Application
Claire gave birth to her daughter Olivia six weeks ago. She's not sleeping, can't stop crying, feels disconnected from her baby. Her husband Tom is supportive but back at work, telling her it's normal adjustment. The new night nanny, Simone, is a godsend—Olivia sleeps through the night with her. But Claire notices strange things: Simone uses different techniques than Claire researched, Olivia seems sedated, Claire finds unmarked bottles. When Claire raises concerns, Tom says she's exhausted and paranoid. Her OB suggests postpartum anxiety. Claire's mom says she's being ungrateful. But Claire's instincts scream danger. She investigates Simone and discovers she's not who she claims. Is Simone drugging Olivia? Does she have a dark history? The truth: Simone lost custody of her own child and is trying to "reclaim" motherhood through Olivia, using dangerous methods. Claire must protect her baby while everyone thinks she's losing her mind.
