# GASLIGHTED SPOUSE

## Core Concept
A partner in a committed relationship who is systematically manipulated to doubt their own memory, perception, and sanity by their spouse or partner. This archetype embodies the horror of intimate betrayal and psychological abuse within the supposed safety of marriage or partnership.

## Psychological Foundation / Motivation
Initially motivated by love, commitment, and desire for a stable partnership. As gaslighting progresses, they become desperate to understand what's real, to save their relationship, and to reclaim their sense of self. Deep fear of abandonment or being "crazy" keeps them trapped even as evidence of manipulation mounts.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Constantly seeks validation from partner about reality
- Apologizes for things they didn't do
- Has trouble making decisions without partner's input
- Memory feels unreliable, keeps notes/journals secretly
- Isolated from friends and family (often gradually)
- Walks on eggshells to avoid partner's "disappointment"
- Physical symptoms of chronic stress (headaches, weight loss/gain, fatigue)
- Torn between love for partner and growing unease
- History of being confident/capable before relationship

## Narrative Use
**Setup requirements:**
- Show the relationship dynamic early—subtle control masked as care
- Establish protagonist's pre-relationship competence through flashbacks
- Demonstrate the partner's charm to others vs. private manipulation
- Small incidents of gaslighting that protagonist dismisses as misunderstanding

**Escalation pattern:**
- Increase frequency of reality-questioning incidents
- Partner denies conversations, commitments, or events
- Others validate partner's version, protagonist feels isolated
- Protagonist discovers evidence contradicting partner's claims
- Partner escalates control tactics when questioned
- Protagonist's mental health deteriorates visibly
- Outside perspective reveals truth protagonist can't see

**Payoff considerations:**
- Must show protagonist reclaiming their reality and agency
- Partner's motivation must be revealed (financial, psychological, criminal)
- Resolution requires protagonist trusting themselves over partner
- Escape or confrontation must feel earned and difficult

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with:
- Charming manipulator antagonist
- Hidden past secrets
- Financial/inheritance motives
- Dual POV (showing antagonist's perspective)
- Isolated settings
- Outsider character who sees the truth
- Journal/evidence discovery
- Past trauma that made protagonist vulnerable

⚠️ Requires careful handling with:
- Mental illness themes (avoid stigmatization)
- Reader sympathy (protagonist must be active not just passive victim)
- Physical abuse (psychological abuse is the focus here)

❌ Avoid combining with:
- Protagonist-is-the-real-villain twist (undermines abuse narrative)
- Easy forgiveness or reconciliation endings
- Trivializing psychological abuse

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Gothic: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
Emma married Jason three years ago after a whirlwind romance. He was everything she wanted—successful, attentive, charming. But gradually, small things started going wrong. Jason insists she agreed to quit her job, though she remembers refusing. Money disappears from their account; he says she spent it. She finds her mother's heirloom necklace missing; Jason claims she lost it months ago. When she questions him, he's hurt, concerned about her memory, suggests she's stressed. Her friends note she's changed, but Jason explains she's going through something. Emma starts recording conversations, keeping evidence. The truth unravels: Jason is systematically destroying her credibility to gain control of her inheritance. The gaslighting is deliberate, calculated, and has been happening since before the wedding.
