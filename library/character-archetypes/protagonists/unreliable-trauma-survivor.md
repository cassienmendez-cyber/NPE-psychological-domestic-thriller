# UNRELIABLE TRAUMA SURVIVOR

## Core Concept
A protagonist who has survived significant trauma (assault, accident, violent crime) and now experiences flashbacks, dissociation, memory gaps, and PTSD symptoms that make them genuinely unreliable as a narrator. Their trauma response makes it impossible for them (and the reader) to trust their perception of present danger.

## Psychological Foundation / Motivation
Motivated by the need to heal, to feel safe again, and to reclaim their life from the trauma. They're caught between wanting to move forward and being trapped in the past. They desperately want to trust their own mind but know their perception is compromised. Fear of being victimized again drives hypervigilance, but trauma makes them misinterpret threats.

## Key Characteristics / Techniques
- Flashbacks triggered by sensory details (smell, sound, touch)
- Dissociative episodes where they lose time
- Panic attacks that feel like present danger
- Nightmares that blend with waking life
- Difficulty distinguishing past from present threats
- Substance use or avoidance behaviors
- Trust issues, especially with people similar to original perpetrator
- Physical scars or reminders of trauma
- In therapy but progress is nonlinear
- Genuine memory gaps from trauma

## Narrative Use
**Setup requirements:**
- Establish the traumatic event early (can be revealed gradually)
- Show their coping mechanisms and support system
- Demonstrate a flashback/episode so reader understands unreliability
- Introduce new situation that may trigger them OR may be genuine threat
- Make reader uncertain what's real vs. trauma response

**Escalation pattern:**
- New situation contains elements similar to original trauma
- Protagonist can't tell if they're reliving past or facing new threat
- Others around them question their stability
- Protagonist loses trust in their own memory and perception
- Evidence emerges that could support either interpretation
- Support system erodes as behavior becomes concerning
- Forced to act despite not trusting their own judgment

**Payoff considerations:**
- Must respectfully portray trauma and PTSD
- Resolution should show trauma as real, not "all in their head"
- New threat should be real, validating their fears
- Arc involves learning to trust themselves while acknowledging limitations
- Healing is not complete but progress is made

## Compatible Elements
✅ Works well with:
- Unreliable narrator structure
- First person POV
- Therapist confidant character
- Past/present timeline structure
- Similar-looking antagonist (triggering resemblance)
- Isolated recovery setting
- Medical/pharmaceutical elements
- Support group dynamics

⚠️ Requires careful handling with:
- Mental illness stigma
- Sexual assault depictions
- Graphic violence flashbacks
- Making protagonist too passive
- Trivializing PTSD

❌ Avoid combining with:
- "Trauma made them stronger" narratives
- Quick/complete recovery arcs
- Using trauma as simple plot device
- Making mental health struggles the "real" villain

## Genre Fit
- Psychological thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Domestic thriller: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Gothic: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Example Application
Maya survived a brutal home invasion two years ago where her boyfriend was killed. She's in EMDR therapy, on medication, rebuilding her life. She moves to a new apartment for a fresh start. But soon she experiences déjà vu—a man who looks like her attacker in the lobby, sounds at night identical to that night, objects moved like before. Is someone targeting her again, or is her PTSD making her relive the trauma? She can't trust her memory—she has gaps from that night. Her therapist suggests the move triggered her. But when she finds evidence someone has been in her apartment, is it real or is she planting it unconsciously? The reader experiences her confusion, unable to parse reality from traumatic intrusion until the reveal: her attacker's brother is stalking her, re-creating that night deliberately.

## Chapter-Level Beats
**Chapters 1-5:** Establish Maya's trauma, recovery progress, move to new place, first triggering incident
**Chapters 6-10:** Escalating incidents that mirror original trauma, Maya questions reality, seeks help
**Chapters 11-15:** Pattern emerges, Maya investigates, has episodes that make evidence questionable
**Chapters 16-20:** Major flashback/episode, others question her stability, Midpoint Twist: undeniable proof of external threat
**Chapters 21-30:** Maya must investigate despite not trusting herself, discovers connection to original crime
**Chapters 31-37:** Confrontation with new threat, forced to act despite trauma response, climax merges past and present
**Chapters 38-40:** Resolution, Maya processes both traumas, establishes new baseline for safety, continues healing journey
